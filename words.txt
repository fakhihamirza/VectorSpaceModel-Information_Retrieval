the
horse
stealers
a
hospital
assistant
called
yergunov
an
empty
headed
fellow
known
throughout
the
district
as
a
great
braggart
and
drunkard
was
returning
one
evening
in
christmas
week
from
the
hamlet
of
ryepino
where
he
had
been
to
make
some
purchases
for
the
hospital
that
he
might
get
home
in
good
time
and
not
be
late
the
doctor
had
lent
him
his
very
best
horse
at
first
it
had
been
a
still
day
but
at
eight
o
clock
a
violent
snow
storm
came
on
and
when
he
was
only
about
four
miles
from
home
yergunov
completely
lost
his
way
he
did
not
know
how
to
drive
he
did
not
know
the
road
and
he
drove
on
at
random
hoping
that
the
horse
would
find
the
way
of
itself
two
hours
passed
the
horse
was
exhausted
he
himself
was
chilled
and
already
began
to
fancy
that
he
was
not
going
home
but
back
towards
ryepino
but
at
last
above
the
uproar
of
the
storm
he
heard
the
far
away
barking
of
a
dog
and
a
murky
red
blur
came
into
sight
ahead
of
him
little
by
little
the
outlines
of
a
high
gate
could
be
discerned
then
a
long
fence
on
which
there
were
nails
with
their
points
uppermost
and
beyond
the
fence
there
stood
the
slanting
crane
of
a
well
the
wind
drove
away
the
mist
of
snow
from
before
the
eyes
and
where
there
had
been
a
red
blur
there
sprang
up
a
small
squat
little
house
with
a
steep
thatched
roof
of
the
three
little
windows
one
covered
on
the
inside
with
something
red
was
lighted
up
what
sort
of
place
was
it
yergunov
remembered
that
to
the
right
of
the
road
three
and
a
half
or
four
miles
from
the
hospital
there
was
andrey
tchirikov
s
tavern
he
remembered
too
that
this
tchirikov
who
had
been
lately
killed
by
some
sledge
drivers
had
left
a
wife
and
a
daughter
called
lyubka
who
had
come
to
the
hospital
two
years
before
as
a
patient
the
inn
had
a
bad
reputation
and
to
visit
it
late
in
the
evening
and
especially
with
someone
else
s
horse
was
not
free
from
risk
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
yergunov
fumbled
in
his
knapsack
for
his
revolver
and
coughing
sternly
tapped
at
the
window
frame
with
his
whip
hey
who
is
within
he
cried
hey
granny
let
me
come
in
and
get
warm
with
a
hoarse
bark
a
black
dog
rolled
like
a
ball
under
the
horse
s
feet
then
another
white
one
then
another
black
one
there
must
have
been
a
dozen
of
them
yergunov
looked
to
see
which
was
the
biggest
swung
his
whip
and
lashed
at
it
with
all
his
might
a
small
long
legged
puppy
turned
its
sharp
muzzle
upwards
and
set
up
a
shrill
piercing
howl
yergunov
stood
for
a
long
while
at
the
window
tapping
but
at
last
the
hoar
frost
on
the
trees
near
the
house
glowed
red
and
a
muffled
female
figure
appeared
with
a
lantern
in
her
hands
let
me
in
to
get
warm
granny
said
yergunov
i
was
driving
to
the
hospital
and
i
have
lost
my
way
it
s
such
weather
god
preserve
us
don
t
be
afraid
we
are
your
own
people
granny
all
my
own
people
are
at
home
and
we
didn
t
invite
strangers
said
the
figure
grimly
and
what
are
you
knocking
for
the
gate
is
not
locked
yergunov
drove
into
the
yard
and
stopped
at
the
steps
bid
your
labourer
take
my
horse
out
granny
said
he
i
am
not
granny
and
indeed
she
was
not
a
granny
while
she
was
putting
out
the
lantern
the
light
fell
on
her
face
and
yergunov
saw
black
eyebrows
and
recognized
lyubka
there
are
no
labourers
about
now
she
said
as
she
went
into
the
house
some
are
drunk
and
asleep
and
some
have
been
gone
to
ryepino
since
the
morning
it
s
a
holiday
as
he
fastened
his
horse
up
in
the
shed
yergunov
heard
a
neigh
and
distinguished
in
the
darkness
another
horse
and
felt
on
it
a
cossack
saddle
so
there
must
be
someone
else
in
the
house
besides
the
woman
and
her
daughter
for
greater
security
yergunov
unsaddled
his
horse
and
when
he
went
into
the
house
took
with
him
both
his
purchases
and
his
saddle
the
first
room
into
which
he
went
was
large
and
very
hot
and
smelt
of
freshly
washed
floors
a
short
lean
peasant
of
about
forty
with
a
small
fair
beard
wearing
a
dark
blue
shirt
was
sitting
at
the
table
under
the
holy
images
it
was
kalashnikov
an
arrant
scoundrel
and
horse
stealer
whose
father
and
uncle
kept
a
tavern
in
bogalyovka
and
disposed
of
the
stolen
horses
where
they
could
he
too
had
been
to
the
hospital
more
than
once
not
for
medical
treatment
but
to
see
the
doctor
about
horses
to
ask
whether
he
had
not
one
for
sale
and
whether
his
honour
would
not
like
to
swop
his
bay
mare
for
a
dun
coloured
gelding
now
his
head
was
pomaded
and
a
silver
ear
ring
glittered
in
his
ear
and
altogether
he
had
a
holiday
air
frowning
and
dropping
his
lower
lip
he
was
looking
intently
at
a
big
dog
s
eared
picture
book
another
peasant
lay
stretched
on
the
floor
near
the
stove
his
head
his
shoulders
and
his
chest
were
covered
with
a
sheepskin
he
was
probably
asleep
beside
his
new
boots
with
shining
bits
of
metal
on
the
heels
there
were
two
dark
pools
of
melted
snow
seeing
the
hospital
assistant
kalashnikov
greeted
him
yes
it
is
weather
said
yergunov
rubbing
his
chilled
knees
with
his
open
hands
the
snow
is
up
to
one
s
neck
i
am
soaked
to
the
skin
i
can
tell
you
and
i
believe
my
revolver
is
too
he
took
out
his
revolver
looked
it
all
over
and
put
it
back
in
his
knapsack
but
the
revolver
made
no
impression
at
all
the
peasant
went
on
looking
at
the
book
yes
it
is
weather
i
lost
my
way
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
dogs
here
i
do
believe
it
would
have
been
my
death
there
would
have
been
a
nice
to
do
and
where
are
the
women
the
old
woman
has
gone
to
ryepino
and
the
girl
is
getting
supper
ready
answered
kalashnikov
silence
followed
yergunov
shivering
and
gasping
breathed
on
his
hands
huddled
up
and
made
a
show
of
being
very
cold
and
exhausted
the
still
angry
dogs
could
be
heard
howling
outside
it
was
dreary
you
come
from
bogalyovka
don
t
you
he
asked
the
peasant
sternly
yes
from
bogalyovka
and
to
while
away
the
time
yergunov
began
to
think
about
bogalyovka
it
was
a
big
village
and
it
lay
in
a
deep
ravine
so
that
when
one
drove
along
the
highroad
on
a
moonlight
night
and
looked
down
into
the
dark
ravine
and
then
up
at
the
sky
it
seemed
as
though
the
moon
were
hanging
over
a
bottomless
abyss
and
it
were
the
end
of
the
world
the
path
going
down
was
steep
winding
and
so
narrow
that
when
one
drove
down
to
bogalyovka
on
account
of
some
epidemic
or
to
vaccinate
the
people
one
had
to
shout
at
the
top
of
one
s
voice
or
whistle
all
the
way
for
if
one
met
a
cart
coming
up
one
could
not
pass
the
peasants
of
bogalyovka
had
the
reputation
of
being
good
gardeners
and
horse
stealers
they
had
well
stocked
gardens
in
spring
the
whole
village
was
buried
in
white
cherry
blossom
and
in
the
summer
they
sold
cherries
at
three
kopecks
a
pail
one
could
pay
three
kopecks
and
pick
as
one
liked
their
women
were
handsome
and
looked
well
fed
they
were
fond
of
finery
and
never
did
anything
even
on
working
days
but
spent
all
their
time
sitting
on
the
ledge
in
front
of
their
houses
and
searching
in
each
other
s
heads
but
at
last
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
lyubka
a
girl
of
twenty
with
bare
feet
and
a
red
dress
came
into
the
room
she
looked
sideways
at
yergunov
and
walked
twice
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
she
did
not
move
simply
but
with
tiny
steps
thrusting
forward
her
bosom
evidently
she
enjoyed
padding
about
with
her
bare
feet
on
the
freshly
washed
floor
and
had
taken
off
her
shoes
on
purpose
kalashnikov
laughed
at
something
and
beckoned
her
with
his
finger
she
went
up
to
the
table
and
he
showed
her
a
picture
of
the
prophet
elijah
who
driving
three
horses
abreast
was
dashing
up
to
the
sky
lyubka
put
her
elbow
on
the
table
her
plait
fell
across
her
shoulder
a
long
chestnut
plait
tied
with
red
ribbon
at
the
end
and
it
almost
touched
the
floor
she
too
smiled
a
splendid
wonderful
picture
said
kalashnikov
wonderful
he
repeated
and
motioned
with
his
hand
as
though
he
wanted
to
take
the
reins
instead
of
elijah
the
wind
howled
in
the
stove
something
growled
and
squeaked
as
though
a
big
dog
had
strangled
a
rat
ugh
the
unclean
spirits
are
abroad
said
lyubka
that
s
the
wind
said
kalashnikov
and
after
a
pause
he
raised
his
eyes
to
yergunov
and
asked
and
what
is
your
learned
opinion
osip
vassilyitch
are
there
devils
in
this
world
or
not
what
s
one
to
say
brother
said
yergunov
and
he
shrugged
one
shoulder
if
one
reasons
from
science
of
course
there
are
no
devils
for
it
s
a
superstition
but
if
one
looks
at
it
simply
as
you
and
i
do
now
there
are
devils
to
put
it
shortly
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
in
my
life
when
i
finished
my
studies
i
served
as
medical
assistant
in
the
army
in
a
regiment
of
the
dragoons
and
i
have
been
in
the
war
of
course
i
have
a
medal
and
a
decoration
from
the
red
cross
but
after
the
treaty
of
san
stefano
i
returned
to
russia
and
went
into
the
service
of
the
zemstvo
and
in
consequence
of
my
enormous
circulation
about
the
world
i
may
say
i
have
seen
more
than
many
another
has
dreamed
of
it
has
happened
to
me
to
see
devils
too
that
is
not
devils
with
horns
and
a
tail
that
is
all
nonsense
but
just
to
speak
precisely
something
of
the
sort
where
asked
kalashnikov
in
various
places
there
is
no
need
to
go
far
last
year
i
met
him
here
speak
of
him
not
at
night
near
this
very
inn
i
was
driving
i
remember
to
golyshino
i
was
going
there
to
vaccinate
of
course
as
usual
i
had
the
racing
droshky
and
a
horse
and
all
the
necessary
paraphernalia
and
what
s
more
i
had
a
watch
and
all
the
rest
of
it
so
i
was
on
my
guard
as
i
drove
along
for
fear
of
some
mischance
there
are
lots
of
tramps
of
all
sorts
i
came
up
to
the
zmeinoy
ravine
damnation
take
it
and
was
just
going
down
it
when
all
at
once
somebody
comes
up
to
me
such
a
fellow
black
hair
black
eyes
and
his
whole
face
looked
smutted
with
soot
he
comes
straight
up
to
the
horse
and
takes
hold
of
the
left
rein
stop
he
looked
at
the
horse
then
at
me
then
dropped
the
reins
and
without
saying
a
bad
word
where
are
you
going
says
he
and
he
showed
his
teeth
in
a
grin
and
his
eyes
were
spiteful
looking
ah
thought
i
you
are
a
queer
customer
i
am
going
to
vaccinate
for
the
smallpox
said
i
and
what
is
that
to
you
well
if
that
s
so
says
he
vaccinate
me
he
bared
his
arm
and
thrust
it
under
my
nose
of
course
i
did
not
bandy
words
with
him
i
just
vaccinated
him
to
get
rid
of
him
afterwards
i
looked
at
my
lancet
and
it
had
gone
rusty
the
peasant
who
was
asleep
near
the
stove
suddenly
turned
over
and
flung
off
the
sheepskin
to
his
great
surprise
yergunov
recognized
the
stranger
he
had
met
that
day
at
zmeinoy
ravine
this
peasant
s
hair
beard
and
eyes
were
black
as
soot
his
face
was
swarthy
and
to
add
to
the
effect
there
was
a
black
spot
the
size
of
a
lentil
on
his
right
cheek
he
looked
mockingly
at
the
hospital
assistant
and
said
i
did
take
hold
of
the
left
rein
that
was
so
but
about
the
smallpox
you
are
lying
sir
and
there
was
not
a
word
said
about
the
smallpox
between
us
yergunov
was
disconcerted
i
m
not
talking
about
you
he
said
lie
down
since
you
are
lying
down
the
dark
skinned
peasant
had
never
been
to
the
hospital
and
yergunov
did
not
know
who
he
was
or
where
he
came
from
and
now
looking
at
him
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
man
must
be
a
gypsy
the
peasant
got
up
and
stretching
and
yawning
loudly
went
up
to
lyubka
and
kalashnikov
and
sat
down
beside
them
and
he
too
began
looking
at
the
book
his
sleepy
face
softened
and
a
look
of
envy
came
into
it
look
merik
lyubka
said
to
him
get
me
such
horses
and
i
will
drive
to
heaven
sinners
can
t
drive
to
heaven
said
kalashnikov
that
s
for
holiness
then
lyubka
laid
the
table
and
brought
in
a
big
piece
of
fat
bacon
salted
cucumbers
a
wooden
platter
of
boiled
meat
cut
up
into
little
pieces
then
a
frying
pan
in
which
there
were
sausages
and
cabbage
spluttering
a
cut
glass
decanter
of
vodka
which
diffused
a
smell
of
orange
peel
all
over
the
room
when
it
was
poured
out
was
put
on
the
table
also
yergunov
was
annoyed
that
kalashnikov
and
the
dark
fellow
merik
talked
together
and
took
no
notice
of
him
at
all
behaving
exactly
as
though
he
were
not
in
the
room
and
he
wanted
to
talk
to
them
to
brag
to
drink
to
have
a
good
meal
and
if
possible
to
have
a
little
fun
with
lyubka
who
sat
down
near
him
half
a
dozen
times
while
they
were
at
supper
and
as
though
by
accident
brushed
against
him
with
her
handsome
shoulders
and
passed
her
hands
over
her
broad
hips
she
was
a
healthy
active
girl
always
laughing
and
never
still
she
would
sit
down
then
get
up
and
when
she
was
sitting
down
she
would
keep
turning
first
her
face
and
then
her
back
to
her
neighbour
like
a
fidgety
child
and
never
failed
to
brush
against
him
with
her
elbows
or
her
knees
and
he
was
displeased
too
that
the
peasants
drank
only
a
glass
each
and
no
more
and
it
was
awkward
for
him
to
drink
alone
but
he
could
not
refrain
from
taking
a
second
glass
all
the
same
then
a
third
and
he
ate
all
the
sausage
he
brought
himself
to
flatter
the
peasants
that
they
might
accept
him
as
one
of
the
party
instead
of
holding
him
at
arm
s
length
you
are
a
fine
set
of
fellows
in
bogalyovka
he
said
and
wagged
his
head
in
what
way
fine
fellows
enquired
kalashnikov
why
about
horses
for
instance
fine
fellows
at
stealing
h
m
fine
fellows
you
call
them
nothing
but
thieves
and
drunkards
they
have
had
their
day
but
it
is
over
said
merik
after
a
pause
but
now
they
have
only
filya
left
and
he
is
blind
yes
there
is
no
one
but
filya
said
kalashnikov
with
a
sigh
reckon
it
up
he
must
be
seventy
the
german
settlers
knocked
out
one
of
his
eyes
and
he
does
not
see
well
with
the
other
it
is
cataract
in
old
days
the
police
officer
would
shout
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
hey
you
shamil
and
all
the
peasants
called
him
that
he
was
shamil
all
over
the
place
and
now
his
only
name
is
one
eyed
filya
but
he
was
a
fine
fellow
lyuba
s
father
andrey
grigoritch
and
he
stole
one
night
into
rozhnovo
there
were
cavalry
regiments
stationed
there
and
carried
off
nine
of
the
soldiers
horses
the
very
best
of
them
they
weren
t
frightened
of
the
sentry
and
in
the
morning
they
sold
all
the
horses
for
twenty
roubles
to
the
gypsy
afonka
yes
but
nowadays
a
man
contrives
to
carry
off
a
horse
whose
rider
is
drunk
or
asleep
and
has
no
fear
of
god
but
will
take
the
very
boots
from
a
drunkard
and
then
salinks
off
and
goes
away
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
with
a
horse
and
haggles
at
the
market
haggles
like
a
jew
till
the
policeman
catches
him
the
fool
there
is
no
fun
in
it
it
is
simply
a
disgrace
a
paltry
set
of
people
i
must
say
what
about
merik
asked
lyubka
merik
is
not
one
of
us
said
kalashnikov
he
is
a
harkov
man
from
mizhiritch
but
that
he
is
a
bold
fellow
that
s
the
truth
there
s
no
gainsaying
that
he
is
a
fine
fellow
lyubka
looked
slily
and
gleefully
at
merik
and
said
it
wasn
t
for
nothing
they
dipped
him
in
a
hole
in
the
ice
how
was
that
asked
yergunov
it
was
like
this
said
merik
and
he
laughed
filya
carried
off
three
horses
from
the
samoylenka
tenants
and
they
pitched
upon
me
there
were
ten
of
the
tenants
at
samoylenka
and
with
their
labourers
there
were
thirty
altogether
and
all
of
them
molokans
so
one
of
them
says
to
me
at
the
market
come
and
have
a
look
merik
we
have
brought
some
new
horses
from
the
fair
i
was
interested
of
course
i
went
up
to
them
and
the
whole
lot
of
them
thirty
men
tied
my
hands
behind
me
and
led
me
to
the
river
we
ll
show
you
fine
horses
they
said
one
hole
in
the
ice
was
there
already
they
cut
another
beside
it
seven
feet
away
then
to
be
sure
they
took
a
cord
and
put
a
noose
under
my
armpits
and
tied
a
crooked
stick
to
the
other
end
long
enough
to
reach
both
holes
they
thrust
the
stick
in
and
dragged
it
through
i
went
plop
into
the
ice
hole
just
as
i
was
in
my
fur
coat
and
my
high
boots
while
they
stood
and
shoved
me
one
with
his
foot
and
one
with
his
stick
then
dragged
me
under
the
ice
and
pulled
me
out
of
the
other
hole
lyubka
shuddered
and
shrugged
at
first
i
was
in
a
fever
from
the
cold
merik
went
on
but
when
they
pulled
me
out
i
was
helpless
and
lay
in
the
snow
and
the
molokans
stood
round
and
hit
me
with
sticks
on
my
knees
and
my
elbows
it
hurt
fearfully
they
beat
me
and
they
went
away
and
everything
on
me
was
frozen
my
clothes
were
covered
with
ice
i
got
up
but
i
couldn
t
move
thank
god
a
woman
drove
by
and
gave
me
a
lift
meanwhile
yergunov
had
drunk
five
or
six
glasses
of
vodka
his
heart
felt
lighter
and
he
longed
to
tell
some
extraordinary
wonderful
story
too
and
to
show
that
he
too
was
a
bold
fellow
and
not
afraid
of
anything
i
ll
tell
you
what
happened
to
us
in
penza
province
he
began
either
because
he
had
drunk
a
great
deal
and
was
a
little
tipsy
or
perhaps
because
he
had
twice
been
detected
in
a
lie
the
peasants
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
him
and
even
left
off
answering
his
questions
what
was
worse
they
permitted
themselves
a
frankness
in
his
presence
that
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
and
cold
all
over
and
that
meant
that
they
took
no
notice
of
him
kalashnikov
had
the
dignified
manners
of
a
sedate
and
sensible
man
he
spoke
weightily
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
his
mouth
every
time
he
yawned
and
no
one
could
have
supposed
that
this
was
a
thief
a
heartless
thief
who
had
stripped
poor
creatures
who
had
already
been
twice
in
prison
and
who
had
been
sentenced
by
the
commune
to
exile
in
siberia
and
had
been
bought
off
by
his
father
and
uncle
who
were
as
great
thieves
and
rogues
as
he
was
merik
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
bravo
he
saw
that
lyubka
and
kalashnikov
were
admiring
him
and
looked
upon
himself
as
a
very
fine
fellow
and
put
his
arms
akimbo
squared
his
chest
or
stretched
so
that
the
bench
creaked
under
him
after
supper
kalashnikov
prayed
to
the
holy
image
without
getting
up
from
his
seat
and
shook
hands
with
merik
the
latter
prayed
too
and
shook
kalashnikov
s
hand
lyubka
cleared
away
the
supper
shook
out
on
the
table
some
peppermint
biscuits
dried
nuts
and
pumpkin
seeds
and
placed
two
bottles
of
sweet
wine
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
peace
everlasting
to
andrey
grigoritch
said
kalashnikov
calinking
glasses
with
merik
when
he
was
alive
we
used
to
gather
together
here
or
at
his
brother
martin
s
and
my
word
my
word
what
men
what
talks
remarkable
conversations
martin
used
to
be
here
and
filya
and
fyodor
stukotey
it
was
all
done
in
style
it
was
all
in
keeping
and
what
fun
we
had
we
did
have
fun
we
did
have
fun
lyubka
went
out
and
soon
afterwards
came
back
wearing
a
green
kerchief
and
beads
look
merik
what
kalashnikov
brought
me
to
day
she
said
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
looking
glass
and
tossed
her
head
several
times
to
make
the
beads
jingle
and
then
she
opened
a
chest
and
began
taking
out
first
a
cotton
dress
with
red
and
blue
flowers
on
it
and
then
a
red
one
with
flounces
which
rustled
and
crackled
like
paper
then
a
new
kerchief
dark
blue
shot
with
many
colours
and
all
these
things
she
showed
and
flung
up
her
hands
laughing
as
though
astonished
that
she
had
such
treasures
kalashnikov
tuned
the
balalaika
and
began
playing
it
but
yergunov
could
not
make
out
what
sort
of
song
he
was
singing
and
whether
it
was
gay
or
melancholy
because
at
one
moment
it
was
so
mournful
he
wanted
to
cry
and
at
the
next
it
would
be
merry
merik
suddenly
jumped
up
and
began
tapping
with
his
heels
on
the
same
spot
then
brandishing
his
arms
he
moved
on
his
heels
from
the
table
to
the
stove
from
the
stove
to
the
chest
then
he
bounded
up
as
though
he
had
been
stung
clicked
the
heels
of
his
boots
together
in
the
air
and
began
going
round
and
round
in
a
crouching
position
lyubka
waved
both
her
arms
uttered
a
desperate
shriek
and
followed
him
at
first
she
moved
sideways
like
a
snake
as
though
she
wanted
to
steal
up
to
someone
and
strike
him
from
behind
she
tapped
rapidly
with
her
bare
heels
as
merik
had
done
with
the
heels
of
his
boots
then
she
turned
round
and
round
like
a
top
and
crouched
down
and
her
red
dress
was
blown
out
like
a
bell
merik
looking
angrily
at
her
and
showing
his
teeth
in
a
grin
flew
towards
her
in
the
same
crouching
posture
as
though
he
wanted
to
crush
her
with
his
terrible
legs
while
she
jumped
up
flung
back
her
head
and
waving
her
arms
as
a
big
bird
does
its
wings
floated
across
the
room
scarcely
touching
the
floor
what
a
flame
of
a
girl
thought
yergunov
sitting
on
the
chest
and
from
there
watching
the
dance
what
fire
give
up
everything
for
her
and
it
would
be
too
little
and
he
regretted
that
he
was
a
hospital
assistant
and
not
a
simple
peasant
that
he
wore
a
reefer
coat
and
a
chain
with
a
gilt
key
on
it
instead
of
a
blue
shirt
with
a
cord
tied
round
the
waist
then
he
could
boldly
have
sung
danced
flung
both
arms
round
lyubka
as
merik
did
the
sharp
tapping
shouts
and
whoops
set
the
crockery
ringing
in
the
cupboard
and
the
flame
of
the
candle
dancing
the
thread
broke
and
the
beads
were
scattered
all
over
the
floor
the
green
kerchief
slipped
off
and
lyubka
was
transformed
into
a
red
cloud
flitting
by
and
flashing
black
eyes
and
it
seemed
as
though
in
another
second
merik
s
arms
and
legs
would
drop
off
but
finally
merik
stamped
for
the
last
time
and
stood
still
as
though
turned
to
stone
exhausted
and
almost
breathless
lyubka
sank
on
to
his
bosom
and
leaned
against
him
as
against
a
post
and
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
looking
into
her
eyes
said
tenderly
and
caressingly
as
though
in
jest
i
ll
find
out
where
your
old
mother
s
money
is
hidden
i
ll
murder
her
and
cut
your
little
throat
for
you
and
after
that
i
will
set
fire
to
the
inn
people
will
think
you
have
perished
in
the
fire
and
with
your
money
i
shall
go
to
kuban
i
ll
keep
droves
of
horses
and
flocks
of
sheep
lyubka
made
no
answer
but
only
looked
at
him
with
a
guilty
air
and
asked
and
is
it
nice
in
kuban
merik
he
said
nothing
but
went
to
the
chest
sat
down
and
sank
into
thought
most
likely
he
was
dreaming
of
kuban
it
s
time
for
me
to
be
going
said
kalashnikov
getting
up
filya
must
be
waiting
for
me
goodbye
lyuba
yergunov
went
out
into
the
yard
to
see
that
kalashnikov
did
not
go
off
with
his
horse
the
snowstorm
still
persisted
white
clouds
were
floating
about
the
yard
their
long
tails
clinging
to
the
rough
grass
and
the
bushes
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
the
open
country
huge
giants
in
white
robes
with
wide
sleeves
were
whirling
round
and
falling
to
the
ground
and
getting
up
again
to
wave
their
arms
and
fight
and
the
wind
the
wind
the
bare
birches
and
cherry
trees
unable
to
endure
its
rude
caresses
bowed
low
down
to
the
ground
and
wailed
god
for
what
sin
hast
thou
bound
us
to
the
earth
and
will
not
let
us
go
free
wo
said
kalashnikov
sternly
and
he
got
on
his
horse
one
half
of
the
gate
was
opened
and
by
it
lay
a
high
snowdrift
well
get
on
shouted
kalashnikov
his
little
short
legged
nag
set
off
and
sank
up
to
its
stomach
in
the
drift
at
once
kalashnikov
was
white
all
over
with
the
snow
and
soon
vanished
from
sight
with
his
horse
when
yergunov
went
back
into
the
room
lyubka
was
creeping
about
the
floor
picking
up
her
beads
merik
was
not
there
a
splendid
girl
thought
yergunov
as
he
lay
down
on
the
bench
and
put
his
coat
under
his
head
oh
if
only
merik
were
not
here
lyubka
excited
him
as
she
crept
about
the
floor
by
the
bench
and
he
thought
that
if
merik
had
not
been
there
he
would
certainly
have
got
up
and
embraced
her
and
then
one
would
see
what
would
happen
it
was
true
she
was
only
a
girl
but
not
likely
to
be
chaste
and
even
if
she
were
need
one
stand
on
ceremony
in
a
den
of
thieves
lyubka
collected
her
beads
and
went
out
the
candle
burnt
down
and
the
flame
caught
the
paper
in
the
candlestick
yergunov
laid
his
revolver
and
matches
beside
him
and
put
out
the
candle
the
light
before
the
holy
images
flickered
so
much
that
it
hurt
his
eyes
and
patches
of
light
danced
on
the
ceiling
on
the
floor
and
on
the
cupboard
and
among
them
he
had
visions
of
lyubka
buxom
full
bosomed
now
she
was
turning
round
like
a
top
now
she
was
exhausted
and
breathless
oh
if
the
devils
would
carry
off
that
merik
he
thought
the
little
lamp
gave
a
last
flicker
spluttered
and
went
out
someone
it
must
have
been
merik
came
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
for
an
instant
lighted
up
a
dark
cheek
with
a
patch
on
it
yergunov
s
throat
was
irritated
by
the
horrible
fumes
of
the
tobacco
smoke
what
filthy
tobacco
you
have
got
damnation
take
it
said
yergunov
it
makes
me
positively
sick
i
mix
my
tobacco
with
the
flowers
of
the
oats
answered
merik
after
a
pause
it
is
better
for
the
chest
he
smoked
spat
and
went
out
again
half
an
hour
passed
and
all
at
once
there
was
the
gleam
of
a
light
in
the
passage
merik
appeared
in
a
coat
and
cap
then
lyubka
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
do
stay
merik
said
lyubka
in
an
imploring
voice
no
lyuba
don
t
keep
me
listen
merik
said
lyubka
and
her
voice
grew
soft
and
tender
i
know
you
will
find
mother
s
money
and
will
do
for
her
and
for
me
and
will
go
to
kuban
and
love
other
girls
but
god
be
with
you
i
only
ask
you
one
thing
sweetheart
do
stay
no
i
want
some
fun
said
merik
fastening
his
belt
but
you
have
nothing
to
go
on
you
came
on
foot
what
are
you
going
on
merik
bent
down
to
lyubka
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
looked
towards
the
door
and
laughed
through
her
tears
he
is
asleep
the
puffed
up
devil
she
said
merik
embraced
her
kissed
her
vigorously
and
went
out
yergunov
thrust
his
revolver
into
his
pocket
jumped
up
and
ran
after
him
get
out
of
the
way
he
said
to
lyubka
who
hurriedly
bolted
the
door
of
the
entry
and
stood
across
the
threshold
let
me
pass
why
are
you
standing
here
what
do
you
want
to
go
out
for
to
have
a
look
at
my
horse
lyubka
gazed
up
at
him
with
a
sly
and
caressing
look
why
look
at
it
you
had
better
look
at
me
she
said
then
she
bent
down
and
touched
with
her
finger
the
gilt
watch
key
that
hung
on
his
chain
let
me
pass
or
he
will
go
off
on
my
horse
said
yergunov
let
me
go
you
devil
he
shouted
and
giving
her
an
angry
blow
on
the
shoulder
he
pressed
his
chest
against
her
with
all
his
might
to
push
her
away
from
the
door
but
she
kept
tight
hold
of
the
bolt
and
was
like
iron
let
me
go
he
shouted
exhausted
he
will
go
off
with
it
i
tell
you
why
should
he
he
won
t
breathing
hard
and
rubbing
her
shoulder
which
hurt
she
looked
up
at
him
again
flushed
a
little
and
laughed
don
t
go
away
dear
heart
she
said
i
am
dull
alone
yergunov
looked
into
her
eyes
hesitated
and
put
his
arms
round
her
she
did
not
resist
come
no
nonsense
let
me
go
he
begged
her
she
did
not
speak
i
heard
you
just
now
he
said
telling
merik
that
you
love
him
i
dare
say
my
heart
knows
who
it
is
i
love
she
put
her
finger
on
the
key
again
and
said
softly
give
me
that
yergunov
unfastened
the
key
and
gave
it
to
her
she
suddenly
craned
her
neck
and
listened
with
a
grave
face
and
her
expression
struck
yergunov
as
cold
and
cunning
he
thought
of
his
horse
and
now
easily
pushed
her
aside
and
ran
out
into
the
yard
in
the
shed
a
sleepy
pig
was
grunting
with
lazy
regularity
and
a
cow
was
knocking
her
horn
yergunov
lighted
a
match
and
saw
the
pig
and
the
cow
and
the
dogs
which
rushed
at
him
on
all
sides
at
seeing
the
light
but
there
was
no
trace
of
the
horse
shouting
and
waving
his
arms
at
the
dogs
stumbling
over
the
drifts
and
sticking
in
the
snow
he
ran
out
at
the
gate
and
fell
to
gazing
into
the
darkness
he
strained
his
eyes
to
the
utmost
and
saw
only
the
snow
flying
and
the
snowflakes
distinctly
forming
into
all
sorts
of
shapes
at
one
moment
the
white
laughing
face
of
a
corpse
would
peep
out
of
the
darkness
at
the
next
a
white
horse
would
gallop
by
with
an
amazon
in
a
muslin
dress
upon
it
at
the
next
a
string
of
white
swans
would
fly
overhead
shaking
with
anger
and
cold
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
yergunov
fired
his
revolver
at
the
dogs
and
did
not
hit
one
of
them
then
he
rushed
back
to
the
house
when
he
went
into
the
entry
he
distinctly
heard
someone
scurry
out
of
the
room
and
bang
the
door
it
was
dark
in
the
room
yergunov
pushed
against
the
door
it
was
locked
then
lighting
match
after
match
he
rushed
back
into
the
entry
from
there
into
the
kitchen
and
from
the
kitchen
into
a
little
room
where
all
the
walls
were
hung
with
petticoats
and
dresses
where
there
was
a
smell
of
cornflowers
and
fennel
and
a
bedstead
with
a
perfect
mountain
of
pillows
standing
in
the
corner
by
the
stove
this
must
have
been
the
old
mother
s
room
from
there
he
passed
into
another
little
room
and
here
he
saw
lyubka
she
was
lying
on
a
chest
covered
with
a
gay
coloured
patchwork
cotton
quilt
pretending
to
be
asleep
a
little
ikon
lamp
was
burning
in
the
corner
above
the
pillow
where
is
my
horse
yergunov
asked
lyubka
did
not
stir
where
is
my
horse
i
am
asking
you
yergunov
repeated
still
more
sternly
and
he
tore
the
quilt
off
her
i
am
asking
you
she
devil
he
shouted
she
jumped
up
on
her
knees
and
with
one
hand
holding
her
shift
and
with
the
other
trying
to
clutch
the
quilt
huddled
against
the
wall
she
looked
at
yergunov
with
repulsion
and
terror
in
her
eyes
and
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
trap
kept
cunning
watch
on
his
faintest
movement
tell
me
where
my
horse
is
or
i
ll
knock
the
life
out
of
you
shouted
yergunov
get
away
dirty
brute
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
yergunov
seized
her
by
the
shift
near
the
neck
and
tore
it
and
then
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
with
all
his
might
embraced
the
girl
but
hissing
with
fury
she
slipped
out
of
his
arms
and
freeing
one
hand
the
other
was
tangled
in
the
torn
shift
hit
him
a
blow
with
her
fist
on
the
skull
his
head
was
dizzy
with
the
pain
there
was
a
ringing
and
rattling
in
his
ears
he
staggered
back
and
at
that
moment
received
another
blow
this
time
on
the
temple
reeling
and
clutching
at
the
doorposts
that
he
might
not
fall
he
made
his
way
to
the
room
where
his
things
were
and
lay
down
on
the
bench
then
after
lying
for
a
little
time
took
the
matchbox
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
lighting
match
after
match
for
no
object
he
lit
it
blew
it
out
and
threw
it
under
the
table
and
went
on
till
all
the
matches
were
gone
meanwhile
the
air
began
to
turn
blue
outside
the
cocks
began
to
crow
but
his
head
still
ached
and
there
was
an
uproar
in
his
ears
as
though
he
were
sitting
under
a
railway
bridge
and
hearing
the
trains
passing
over
his
head
he
got
somehow
into
his
coat
and
cap
the
saddle
and
the
bundle
of
his
purchases
he
could
not
find
his
knapsack
was
empty
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
someone
had
scurried
out
of
the
room
when
he
came
in
from
the
yard
he
took
a
poker
from
the
kitchen
to
keep
off
the
dogs
and
went
out
into
the
yard
leaving
the
door
open
the
snow
storm
had
subsided
and
it
was
calm
outside
when
he
went
out
at
the
gate
the
white
plain
looked
dead
and
there
was
not
a
single
bird
in
the
morning
sky
on
both
sides
of
the
road
and
in
the
distance
there
were
bluish
patches
of
young
copse
yergunov
began
thinking
how
he
would
be
greeted
at
the
hospital
and
what
the
doctor
would
say
to
him
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
think
of
that
and
to
prepare
beforehand
to
answer
questions
he
would
be
asked
but
this
thought
grew
blurred
and
slipped
away
he
walked
along
thinking
of
nothing
but
lyubka
of
the
peasants
with
whom
he
had
passed
the
night
he
remembered
how
after
lyubka
struck
him
the
second
time
she
had
bent
down
to
the
floor
for
the
quilt
and
how
her
loose
hair
had
fallen
on
the
floor
his
mind
was
in
a
maze
and
he
wondered
why
there
were
in
the
world
doctors
hospital
assistants
merchants
clerks
and
peasants
instead
of
simple
free
men
there
are
to
be
sure
free
birds
free
beasts
a
free
merik
and
they
are
not
afraid
of
anyone
and
don
t
need
anyone
and
whose
idea
was
it
who
had
decreed
that
one
must
get
up
in
the
morning
dine
at
midday
go
to
bed
in
the
evening
that
a
doctor
takes
precedence
of
a
hospital
assistant
that
one
must
live
in
rooms
and
love
only
one
s
wife
and
why
not
the
contrary
dine
at
night
and
sleep
in
the
day
ah
to
jump
on
a
horse
without
enquiring
whose
it
is
to
ride
races
with
the
wind
like
a
devil
over
fields
and
forests
and
ravines
to
make
love
to
girls
to
mock
at
everyone
yergunov
thrust
the
poker
into
the
snow
pressed
his
forehead
to
the
cold
white
trunk
of
a
birch
tree
and
sank
into
thought
and
his
grey
monotonous
life
his
wages
his
subordinate
position
the
dispensary
the
everlasting
to
do
with
the
bottles
and
blisters
struck
him
as
contemptible
sickening
who
says
it
s
a
sin
to
enjoy
oneself
he
asked
himself
with
vexation
those
who
say
that
have
never
lived
in
freedom
like
merik
and
kalashnikov
and
have
never
loved
lyubka
they
have
been
beggars
all
their
lives
have
lived
without
any
pleasure
and
have
only
loved
their
wives
who
are
like
frogs
and
he
thought
about
himself
that
he
had
not
hitherto
been
a
thief
a
swindler
or
even
a
brigand
simply
because
he
could
not
or
had
not
yet
met
with
a
suitable
opportunity
a
year
and
a
half
passed
in
spring
after
easter
yergunov
who
had
long
before
been
dismissed
from
the
hospital
and
was
hanging
about
without
a
job
came
out
of
the
tavern
in
ryepino
and
sauntered
aimlessly
along
the
street
he
went
out
into
the
open
country
here
there
was
the
scent
of
spring
and
a
warm
caressing
wind
was
blowing
the
calm
starry
night
looked
down
from
the
sky
on
the
earth
my
god
how
infinite
the
depth
of
the
sky
and
with
what
fathomless
immensity
it
stretched
over
the
world
the
world
is
created
well
enough
only
why
and
with
what
right
do
people
thought
yergunov
divide
their
fellows
into
the
sober
and
the
drunken
the
employed
and
the
dismissed
and
so
on
why
do
the
sober
and
well
fed
sleep
comfortably
in
their
homes
while
the
drunken
and
the
hungry
must
wander
about
the
country
without
a
refuge
why
was
it
that
if
anyone
had
not
a
job
and
did
not
get
a
salary
he
had
to
go
hungry
without
clothes
and
boots
whose
idea
was
it
why
was
it
the
birds
and
the
wild
beasts
in
the
woods
did
not
have
jobs
and
get
salaries
but
lived
as
they
pleased
far
away
in
the
sky
a
beautiful
crimson
glow
lay
quivering
stretched
wide
over
the
horizon
yergunov
stopped
and
for
a
long
time
he
gazed
at
it
and
kept
wondering
why
was
it
that
if
he
had
carried
off
someone
else
s
samovar
the
day
before
and
sold
it
for
drink
in
the
taverns
it
would
be
a
sin
why
was
it
two
carts
drove
by
on
the
road
in
one
of
them
there
was
a
woman
asleep
in
the
other
sat
an
old
man
without
a
cap
on
grandfather
where
is
that
fire
asked
yergunov
andrey
tchirikov
s
inn
answered
the
old
man
and
yergunov
recalled
what
had
happened
to
him
eighteen
months
before
in
the
winter
in
that
very
inn
and
how
merik
had
boasted
and
he
imagined
the
old
woman
and
lyubka
with
their
throats
cut
burning
and
he
envied
merik
and
when
he
walked
back
to
the
tavern
looking
at
the
houses
of
the
rich
publicans
cattle
dealers
and
blacksmiths
he
reflected
how
nice
it
would
be
to
steal
by
night
into
some
rich
man
s
house
ward
no
6
in
the
hospital
yard
there
stands
a
small
lodge
surrounded
by
a
perfect
forest
of
burdocks
nettles
and
wild
hemp
its
roof
is
rusty
the
chimney
is
tumbling
down
the
steps
at
the
front
door
are
rotting
away
and
overgrown
with
grass
and
there
are
only
traces
left
of
the
stucco
the
front
of
the
lodge
faces
the
hospital
at
the
back
it
looks
out
into
the
open
country
from
which
it
is
separated
by
the
grey
hospital
fence
with
nails
on
it
these
nails
with
their
points
upwards
and
the
fence
and
the
lodge
itself
have
that
peculiar
desolate
god
forsaken
look
which
is
only
found
in
our
hospital
and
prison
buildings
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
being
stung
by
the
nettles
come
by
the
narrow
footpath
that
leads
to
the
lodge
and
let
us
see
what
is
going
on
inside
opening
the
first
door
we
walk
into
the
entry
here
along
the
walls
and
by
the
stove
every
sort
of
hospital
rubbish
lies
littered
about
mattresses
old
tattered
dressing
gowns
trousers
blue
striped
shirts
boots
and
shoes
no
good
for
anything
all
these
remnants
are
piled
up
in
heaps
mixed
up
and
crumpled
mouldering
and
giving
out
a
sickly
smell
the
porter
nikita
an
old
soldier
wearing
rusty
good
conduct
stripes
is
always
lying
on
the
litter
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
has
a
grim
surly
battered
looking
face
overhanging
eyebrows
which
give
him
the
expression
of
a
sheep
dog
of
the
steppes
and
a
red
nose
he
is
short
and
looks
thin
and
scraggy
but
he
is
of
imposing
deportment
and
his
fists
are
vigorous
he
belongs
to
the
class
of
simple
hearted
practical
and
dull
witted
people
prompt
in
carrying
out
orders
who
like
discipline
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
so
are
convinced
that
it
is
their
duty
to
beat
people
he
showers
blows
on
the
face
on
the
chest
on
the
back
on
whatever
comes
first
and
is
convinced
that
there
would
be
no
order
in
the
place
if
he
did
not
next
you
come
into
a
big
spacious
room
which
fills
up
the
whole
lodge
except
for
the
entry
here
the
walls
are
painted
a
dirty
blue
the
ceiling
is
as
sooty
as
in
a
hut
without
a
chimney
it
is
evident
that
in
the
winter
the
stove
smokes
and
the
room
is
full
of
fumes
the
windows
are
disfigured
by
iron
gratings
on
the
inside
the
wooden
floor
is
grey
and
full
of
splinters
there
is
a
stench
of
sour
cabbage
of
smouldering
wicks
of
bugs
and
of
ammonia
and
for
the
first
minute
this
stench
gives
you
the
impression
of
having
walked
into
a
menagerie
there
are
bedsteads
screwed
to
the
floor
men
in
blue
hospital
dressing
gowns
and
wearing
nightcaps
in
the
old
style
are
sitting
and
lying
on
them
these
are
the
lunatics
there
are
five
of
them
in
all
here
only
one
is
of
the
upper
class
the
rest
are
all
artisans
the
one
nearest
the
door
a
tall
lean
workman
with
shining
red
whiskers
and
tear
stained
eyes
sits
with
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
staring
at
the
same
point
day
and
night
he
grieves
shaking
his
head
sighing
and
smiling
bitterly
he
takes
a
part
in
conversation
and
usually
makes
no
answer
to
questions
he
eats
and
drinks
mechanically
when
food
is
offered
him
from
his
agonizing
throbbing
cough
his
thinness
and
the
flush
on
his
cheeks
one
may
judge
that
he
is
in
the
first
stage
of
consumption
next
to
him
is
a
little
alert
very
lively
old
man
with
a
pointed
beard
and
curly
black
hair
like
a
negro
s
by
day
he
walks
up
and
down
the
ward
from
window
to
window
or
sits
on
his
bed
cross
legged
like
a
turk
and
ceaselessly
as
a
bullfinch
whistles
softly
sings
and
titters
he
shows
his
childish
gaiety
and
lively
character
at
night
also
when
he
gets
up
to
say
his
prayers
that
is
to
beat
himself
on
the
chest
with
his
fists
and
to
scratch
with
his
fingers
at
the
door
this
is
the
jew
moiseika
an
imbecile
who
went
crazy
twenty
years
ago
when
his
hat
factory
was
burnt
down
and
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
ward
no
6
he
is
the
only
one
who
is
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
lodge
and
even
out
of
the
yard
into
the
street
he
has
enjoyed
this
privilege
for
years
probably
because
he
is
an
old
inhabitant
of
the
hospital
a
quiet
harmless
imbecile
the
buffoon
of
the
town
where
people
are
used
to
seeing
him
surrounded
by
boys
and
dogs
in
his
wretched
gown
in
his
absurd
night
cap
and
in
slippers
sometimes
with
bare
legs
and
even
without
trousers
he
walks
about
the
streets
stopping
at
the
gates
and
little
shops
and
begging
for
a
copper
in
one
place
they
will
give
him
some
kvass
in
another
some
bread
in
another
a
copper
so
that
he
generally
goes
back
to
the
ward
feeling
rich
and
well
fed
everything
that
he
brings
back
nikita
takes
from
him
for
his
own
benefit
the
soldier
does
this
roughly
angrily
turning
the
jew
s
pockets
inside
out
and
calling
god
to
witness
that
he
will
not
let
him
go
into
the
street
again
and
that
breach
of
the
regulations
is
worse
to
him
than
anything
in
the
world
moiseika
likes
to
make
himself
useful
he
gives
his
companions
water
and
covers
them
up
when
they
are
asleep
he
promises
each
of
them
to
bring
him
back
a
kopeck
and
to
make
him
a
new
cap
he
feeds
with
a
spoon
his
neighbour
on
the
left
who
is
paralyzed
he
acts
in
this
way
not
from
compassion
nor
from
any
considerations
of
a
humane
kind
but
through
imitation
unconsciously
dominated
by
gromov
his
neighbour
on
the
right
hand
ivan
dmitritch
gromov
a
man
of
thirty
three
who
is
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
has
been
a
court
usher
and
provincial
secretary
suffers
from
the
mania
of
persecution
he
either
lies
curled
up
in
bed
or
walks
from
corner
to
corner
as
though
for
exercise
he
very
rarely
sits
down
he
is
always
excited
agitated
and
overwrought
by
a
sort
of
vague
undefined
expectation
the
faintest
rustle
in
the
entry
or
shout
in
the
yard
is
enough
to
make
him
raise
his
head
and
begin
listening
whether
they
are
coming
for
him
whether
they
are
looking
for
him
and
at
such
times
his
face
expresses
the
utmost
uneasiness
and
repulsion
i
like
his
broad
face
with
its
high
cheek
bones
always
pale
and
unhappy
and
reflecting
as
though
in
a
mirror
a
soul
tormented
by
conflict
and
long
continued
terror
his
grimaces
are
strange
and
abnormal
but
the
delicate
lines
traced
on
his
face
by
profound
genuine
suffering
show
intelligence
and
sense
and
there
is
a
warm
and
healthy
light
in
his
eyes
i
like
the
man
himself
courteous
anxious
to
be
of
use
and
extraordinarily
gentle
to
everyone
except
nikita
when
anyone
drops
a
button
or
a
spoon
he
jumps
up
from
his
bed
quickly
and
picks
it
up
every
day
he
says
good
morning
to
his
companions
and
when
he
goes
to
bed
he
wishes
them
good
night
besides
his
continually
overwrought
condition
and
his
grimaces
his
madness
shows
itself
in
the
following
way
also
sometimes
in
the
evenings
he
wraps
himself
in
his
dressing
gown
and
trembling
all
over
with
his
teeth
chattering
begins
walking
rapidly
from
corner
to
corner
and
between
the
bedsteads
it
seems
as
though
he
is
in
a
violent
fever
from
the
way
he
suddenly
stops
and
glances
at
his
companions
it
can
be
seen
that
he
is
longing
to
say
something
very
important
but
apparently
reflecting
that
they
would
not
listen
or
would
not
understand
him
he
shakes
his
head
impatiently
and
goes
on
pacing
up
and
down
but
soon
the
desire
to
speak
gets
the
upper
hand
of
every
consideration
and
he
will
let
himself
go
and
speak
fervently
and
passionately
his
talk
is
disordered
and
feverish
like
delirium
disconnected
and
not
always
intelligible
but
on
the
other
hand
something
extremely
fine
may
be
felt
in
it
both
in
the
words
and
the
voice
when
he
talks
you
recognize
in
him
the
lunatic
and
the
man
it
is
difficult
to
reproduce
on
paper
his
insane
talk
he
speaks
of
the
baseness
of
mankind
of
violence
trampling
on
justice
of
the
glorious
life
which
will
one
day
be
upon
earth
of
the
window
gratings
which
remind
him
every
minute
of
the
stupidity
and
cruelty
of
oppressors
it
makes
a
disorderly
incoherent
potpourri
of
themes
old
but
not
yet
out
of
date
ii
some
twelve
or
fifteen
years
ago
an
official
called
gromov
a
highly
respectable
and
prosperous
person
was
living
in
his
own
house
in
the
principal
street
of
the
town
he
had
two
sons
sergey
and
ivan
when
sergey
was
a
student
in
his
fourth
year
he
was
taken
ill
with
galloping
consumption
and
died
and
his
death
was
as
it
were
the
first
of
a
whole
series
of
calamities
which
suddenly
showered
on
the
gromov
family
within
a
week
of
sergey
s
funeral
the
old
father
was
put
on
trial
for
fraud
and
misappropriation
and
he
died
of
typhoid
in
the
prison
hospital
soon
afterwards
the
house
with
all
their
belongings
was
sold
by
auction
and
ivan
dmitritch
and
his
mother
were
left
entirely
without
means
hitherto
in
his
father
s
lifetime
ivan
dmitritch
who
was
studying
in
the
university
of
petersburg
had
received
an
allowance
of
sixty
or
seventy
roubles
a
month
and
had
had
no
conception
of
poverty
now
he
had
to
make
an
abrupt
change
in
his
life
he
had
to
spend
his
time
from
morning
to
night
giving
lessons
for
next
to
nothing
to
work
at
copying
and
with
all
that
to
go
hungry
as
all
his
earnings
were
sent
to
keep
his
mother
ivan
dmitritch
could
not
stand
such
a
life
he
lost
heart
and
strength
and
giving
up
the
university
went
home
here
through
interest
he
obtained
the
post
of
teacher
in
the
district
school
but
could
not
get
on
with
his
colleagues
was
not
liked
by
the
boys
and
soon
gave
up
the
post
his
mother
died
he
was
for
six
months
without
work
living
on
nothing
but
bread
and
water
then
he
became
a
court
usher
he
kept
this
post
until
he
was
dismissed
owing
to
his
illness
he
had
never
even
in
his
young
student
days
given
the
impression
of
being
perfectly
healthy
he
had
always
been
pale
thin
and
given
to
catching
cold
he
ate
little
and
slept
badly
a
single
glass
of
wine
went
to
his
head
and
made
him
hysterical
he
always
had
a
craving
for
society
but
owing
to
his
irritable
temperament
and
suspiciousness
he
never
became
very
intimate
with
anyone
and
had
no
friends
he
always
spoke
with
contempt
of
his
fellow
townsmen
saying
that
their
coarse
ignorance
and
sleepy
animal
existence
seemed
to
him
loathsome
and
horrible
he
spoke
in
a
loud
tenor
with
heat
and
invariably
either
with
scorn
and
indignation
or
with
wonder
and
enthusiasm
and
always
with
perfect
sincerity
whatever
one
talked
to
him
about
he
always
brought
it
round
to
the
same
subject
that
life
was
dull
and
stifling
in
the
town
that
the
townspeople
had
no
lofty
interests
but
lived
a
dingy
meaningless
life
diversified
by
violence
coarse
profligacy
and
hypocrisy
that
scoundrels
were
well
fed
and
clothed
while
honest
men
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
that
they
needed
schools
a
progressive
local
paper
a
theatre
public
lectures
the
co
ordination
of
the
intellectual
elements
that
society
must
see
its
failings
and
be
horrified
in
his
criticisms
of
people
he
laid
on
the
colours
thick
using
only
black
and
white
and
no
fine
shades
mankind
was
divided
for
him
into
honest
men
and
scoundrels
there
was
nothing
in
between
he
always
spoke
with
passion
and
enthusiasm
of
women
and
of
love
but
he
had
never
been
in
love
in
spite
of
the
severity
of
his
judgments
and
his
nervousness
he
was
liked
and
behind
his
back
was
spoken
of
affectionately
as
vanya
his
innate
refinement
and
readiness
to
be
of
service
his
good
breeding
his
moral
purity
and
his
shabby
coat
his
frail
appearance
and
family
misfortunes
aroused
a
kind
warm
sorrowful
feeling
moreover
he
was
well
educated
and
well
read
according
to
the
townspeople
s
notions
he
knew
everything
and
was
in
their
eyes
something
like
a
walking
encyclopedia
he
had
read
a
great
deal
he
would
sit
at
the
club
nervously
pulling
at
his
beard
and
looking
through
the
magazines
and
books
and
from
his
face
one
could
see
that
he
was
not
reading
but
devouring
the
pages
without
giving
himself
time
to
digest
what
he
read
it
must
be
supposed
that
reading
was
one
of
his
morbid
habits
as
he
fell
upon
anything
that
came
into
his
hands
with
equal
avidity
even
last
year
s
newspapers
and
calendars
at
home
he
always
read
lying
down
iii
one
autumn
morning
ivan
dmitritch
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
greatcoat
and
splashing
through
the
mud
made
his
way
by
side
streets
and
back
lanes
to
see
some
artisan
and
to
collect
some
payment
that
was
owing
he
was
in
a
gloomy
mood
as
he
always
was
in
the
morning
in
one
of
the
side
streets
he
was
met
by
two
convicts
in
fetters
and
four
soldiers
with
rifles
in
charge
of
them
ivan
dmitritch
had
very
often
met
convicts
before
and
they
had
always
excited
feelings
of
compassion
and
discomfort
in
him
but
now
this
meeting
made
a
peculiar
strange
impression
on
him
it
suddenly
seemed
to
him
for
some
reason
that
he
too
might
be
put
into
fetters
and
led
through
the
mud
to
prison
like
that
after
visiting
the
artisan
on
the
way
home
he
met
near
the
post
office
a
police
superintendent
of
his
acquaintance
who
greeted
him
and
walked
a
few
paces
along
the
street
with
him
and
for
some
reason
this
seemed
to
him
suspicious
at
home
he
could
not
get
the
convicts
or
the
soldiers
with
their
rifles
out
of
his
head
all
day
and
an
unaccountable
inward
agitation
prevented
him
from
reading
or
concentrating
his
mind
in
the
evening
he
did
not
light
his
lamp
and
at
night
he
could
not
sleep
but
kept
thinking
that
he
might
be
arrested
put
into
fetters
and
thrown
into
prison
he
did
not
know
of
any
harm
he
had
done
and
could
be
certain
that
he
would
never
be
guilty
of
murder
arson
or
theft
in
the
future
either
but
was
it
not
easy
to
commit
a
crime
by
accident
unconsciously
and
was
not
false
witness
always
possible
and
indeed
miscarriage
of
justice
it
was
not
without
good
reason
that
the
agelong
experience
of
the
simple
people
teaches
that
beggary
and
prison
are
ills
none
can
be
safe
from
a
judicial
mistake
is
very
possible
as
legal
proceedings
are
conducted
nowadays
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
wondered
at
in
it
people
who
have
an
official
professional
relation
to
other
men
s
sufferings
for
instance
judges
police
officers
doctors
in
course
of
time
through
habit
grow
so
callous
that
they
can
not
even
if
they
wish
it
take
any
but
a
formal
attitude
to
their
clients
in
this
respect
they
are
not
different
from
the
peasant
who
slaughters
sheep
and
calves
in
the
back
yard
and
does
not
notice
the
blood
with
this
formal
soulless
attitude
to
human
personality
the
judge
needs
but
one
thing
time
in
order
to
deprive
an
innocent
man
of
all
rights
of
property
and
to
condemn
him
to
penal
servitude
only
the
time
spent
on
performing
certain
formalities
for
which
the
judge
is
paid
his
salary
and
then
it
is
all
over
then
you
may
look
in
vain
for
justice
and
protection
in
this
dirty
wretched
little
town
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
a
railway
station
and
indeed
is
it
not
absurd
even
to
think
of
justice
when
every
kind
of
violence
is
accepted
by
society
as
a
rational
and
consistent
necessity
and
every
act
of
mercy
for
instance
a
verdict
of
acquittal
calls
forth
a
perfect
outburst
of
dissatisfied
and
revengeful
feeling
in
the
morning
ivan
dmitritch
got
up
from
his
bed
in
a
state
of
horror
with
cold
perspiration
on
his
forehead
completely
convinced
that
he
might
be
arrested
any
minute
since
his
gloomy
thoughts
of
yesterday
had
haunted
him
so
long
he
thought
it
must
be
that
there
was
some
truth
in
them
they
could
not
indeed
have
come
into
his
mind
without
any
grounds
whatever
a
policeman
walking
slowly
passed
by
the
windows
that
was
not
for
nothing
here
were
two
men
standing
still
and
silent
near
the
house
why
were
they
silent
and
agonizing
days
and
nights
followed
for
ivan
dmitritch
everyone
who
passed
by
the
windows
or
came
into
the
yard
seemed
to
him
a
spy
or
a
detective
at
midday
the
chief
of
the
police
usually
drove
down
the
street
with
a
pair
of
horses
he
was
going
from
his
estate
near
the
town
to
the
police
department
but
ivan
dmitritch
fancied
every
time
that
he
was
driving
especially
quickly
and
that
he
had
a
peculiar
expression
it
was
evident
that
he
was
in
haste
to
announce
that
there
was
a
very
important
criminal
in
the
town
ivan
dmitritch
started
at
every
ring
at
the
bell
and
knock
at
the
gate
and
was
agitated
whenever
he
came
upon
anyone
new
at
his
landlady
s
when
he
met
police
officers
and
gendarmes
he
smiled
and
began
whistling
so
as
to
seem
unconcerned
he
could
not
sleep
for
whole
nights
in
succession
expecting
to
be
arrested
but
he
snored
loudly
and
sighed
as
though
in
deep
sleep
that
his
landlady
might
think
he
was
asleep
for
if
he
could
not
sleep
it
meant
that
he
was
tormented
by
the
stings
of
conscience
what
a
piece
of
evidence
facts
and
common
sense
persuaded
him
that
all
these
terrors
were
nonsense
and
morbidity
that
if
one
looked
at
the
matter
more
broadly
there
was
nothing
really
terrible
in
arrest
and
imprisonment
so
long
as
the
conscience
is
at
ease
but
the
more
sensibly
and
logically
he
reasoned
the
more
acute
and
agonizing
his
mental
distress
became
it
might
be
compared
with
the
story
of
a
hermit
who
tried
to
cut
a
dwelling
place
for
himself
in
a
virgin
forest
the
more
zealously
he
worked
with
his
axe
the
thicker
the
forest
grew
in
the
end
ivan
dmitritch
seeing
it
was
useless
gave
up
reasoning
altogether
and
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
despair
and
terror
he
began
to
avoid
people
and
to
seek
solitude
his
official
work
had
been
distasteful
to
him
before
now
it
became
unbearable
to
him
he
was
afraid
they
would
somehow
get
him
into
trouble
would
put
a
bribe
in
his
pocket
unnoticed
and
then
denounce
him
or
that
he
would
accidentally
make
a
mistake
in
official
papers
that
would
appear
to
be
fraudulent
or
would
lose
other
people
s
money
it
is
strange
that
his
imagination
had
never
at
other
times
been
so
agile
and
inventive
as
now
when
every
day
he
thought
of
thousands
of
different
reasons
for
being
seriously
anxious
over
his
freedom
and
honour
but
on
the
other
hand
his
interest
in
the
outer
world
in
books
in
particular
grew
sensibly
fainter
and
his
memory
began
to
fail
him
in
the
spring
when
the
snow
melted
there
were
found
in
the
ravine
near
the
cemetery
two
half
decomposed
corpses
the
bodies
of
an
old
woman
and
a
boy
bearing
the
traces
of
death
by
violence
nothing
was
talked
of
but
these
bodies
and
their
unknown
murderers
that
people
might
not
think
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
crime
ivan
dmitritch
walked
about
the
streets
smiling
and
when
he
met
acquaintances
he
turned
pale
flushed
and
began
declaring
that
there
was
no
greater
crime
than
the
murder
of
the
weak
and
defenceless
but
this
duplicity
soon
exhausted
him
and
after
some
reflection
he
decided
that
in
his
position
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
hide
in
his
landlady
s
cellar
he
sat
in
the
cellar
all
day
and
then
all
night
then
another
day
was
fearfully
cold
and
waiting
till
dusk
stole
secretly
like
a
thief
back
to
his
room
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
till
daybreak
listening
without
stirring
very
early
in
the
morning
before
sunrise
some
workmen
came
into
the
house
ivan
dmitritch
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
had
come
to
mend
the
stove
in
the
kitchen
but
terror
told
him
that
they
were
police
officers
disguised
as
workmen
he
slipped
stealthily
out
of
the
flat
and
overcome
by
terror
ran
along
the
street
without
his
cap
and
coat
dogs
raced
after
him
barking
a
peasant
shouted
somewhere
behind
him
the
wind
whistled
in
his
ears
and
it
seemed
to
ivan
dmitritch
that
the
force
and
violence
of
the
whole
world
was
massed
together
behind
his
back
and
was
chasing
after
him
he
was
stopped
and
brought
home
and
his
landlady
sent
for
a
doctor
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
of
whom
we
shall
have
more
to
say
hereafter
prescribed
cold
compresses
on
his
head
and
laurel
drops
shook
his
head
and
went
away
telling
the
landlady
he
should
not
come
again
as
one
should
not
interfere
with
people
who
are
going
out
of
their
minds
as
he
had
not
the
means
to
live
at
home
and
be
nursed
ivan
dmitritch
was
soon
sent
to
the
hospital
and
was
there
put
into
the
ward
for
venereal
patients
he
could
not
sleep
at
night
was
full
of
whims
and
fancies
and
disturbed
the
patients
and
was
soon
afterwards
by
andrey
yefimitch
s
orders
transferred
to
ward
no
6
within
a
year
ivan
dmitritch
was
completely
forgotten
in
the
town
and
his
books
heaped
up
by
his
landlady
in
a
sledge
in
the
shed
were
pulled
to
pieces
by
boys
iv
ivan
dmitritch
s
neighbour
on
the
left
hand
is
as
i
have
said
already
the
jew
moiseika
his
neighbour
on
the
right
hand
is
a
peasant
so
rolling
in
fat
that
he
is
almost
spherical
with
a
blankly
stupid
face
utterly
devoid
of
thought
this
is
a
motionless
gluttonous
unclean
animal
who
has
long
ago
lost
all
powers
of
thought
or
feeling
an
acrid
stifling
stench
always
comes
from
him
nikita
who
has
to
clean
up
after
him
beats
him
terribly
with
all
his
might
not
sparing
his
fists
and
what
is
dreadful
is
not
his
being
beaten
that
one
can
get
used
to
but
the
fact
that
this
stupefied
creature
does
not
respond
to
the
blows
with
a
sound
or
a
movement
nor
by
a
look
in
the
eyes
but
only
sways
a
little
like
a
heavy
barrel
the
fifth
and
last
inhabitant
of
ward
no
6
is
a
man
of
the
artisan
class
who
had
once
been
a
sorter
in
the
post
office
a
thinnish
fair
little
man
with
a
good
natured
but
rather
sly
face
to
judge
from
the
clear
cheerful
look
in
his
calm
and
intelligent
eyes
he
has
some
pleasant
idea
in
his
mind
and
has
some
very
important
and
agreeable
secret
he
has
under
his
pillow
and
under
his
mattress
something
that
he
never
shows
anyone
not
from
fear
of
its
being
taken
from
him
and
stolen
but
from
modesty
sometimes
he
goes
to
the
window
and
turning
his
back
to
his
companions
puts
something
on
his
breast
and
bending
his
head
looks
at
it
if
you
go
up
to
him
at
such
a
moment
he
is
overcome
with
confusion
and
snatches
something
off
his
breast
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
guess
his
secret
congratulate
me
he
often
says
to
ivan
dmitritch
i
have
been
presented
with
the
stanislav
order
of
the
second
degree
with
the
star
the
second
degree
with
the
star
is
only
given
to
foreigners
but
for
some
reason
they
want
to
make
an
exception
for
me
he
says
with
a
smile
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
perplexity
that
i
must
confess
i
did
not
expect
i
don
t
understand
anything
about
that
ivan
dmitritch
replies
morosely
but
do
you
know
what
i
shall
attain
to
sooner
or
later
the
former
sorter
persists
screwing
up
his
eyes
slyly
i
shall
certainly
get
the
swedish
polar
star
that
s
an
order
it
is
worth
working
for
a
white
cross
with
a
black
ribbon
it
s
very
beautiful
probably
in
no
other
place
is
life
so
monotonous
as
in
this
ward
in
the
morning
the
patients
except
the
paralytic
and
the
fat
peasant
wash
in
the
entry
at
a
big
tab
and
wipe
themselves
with
the
skirts
of
their
dressing
gowns
after
that
they
drink
tea
out
of
tin
mugs
which
nikita
brings
them
out
of
the
main
building
everyone
is
allowed
one
mugful
at
midday
they
have
soup
made
out
of
sour
cabbage
and
boiled
grain
in
the
evening
their
supper
consists
of
grain
left
from
dinner
in
the
intervals
they
lie
down
sleep
look
out
of
window
and
walk
from
one
corner
to
the
other
and
so
every
day
even
the
former
sorter
always
talks
of
the
same
orders
fresh
faces
are
rarely
seen
in
ward
no

the
doctor
has
not
taken
in
any
new
mental
cases
for
a
long
time
and
the
people
who
are
fond
of
visiting
lunatic
asylums
are
few
in
this
world
once
every
two
months
semyon
lazaritch
the
barber
appears
in
the
ward
how
he
cuts
the
patients
hair
and
how
nikita
helps
him
to
do
it
and
what
a
trepidation
the
lunatics
are
always
thrown
into
by
the
arrival
of
the
drunken
smiling
barber
we
will
not
describe
no
one
even
looks
into
the
ward
except
the
barber

patients
are
condemned
to
see

a
rather
strange
rumour
has
however
been
circulating
in
the
hospital
of
late
it
is
rumoured
that
the
doctor
has
begun
to
visit
ward
no
6
v
a
strange
rumour
dr
andrey
yefimitch
ragin
is
a
strange
man
in
his
way
they
say
that
when
he
was
young
he
was
very
religious
and
prepared
himself
for
a
clerical
career
and
that
when
he
had
finished
his
studies
at
the
high
school
in
1863
he
intended
to
enter
a
theological
academy
but
that
his
father
a
surgeon
and
doctor
of
medicine
jeered
at
him
and
declared
point
blank
that
he
would
disown
him
if
he
became
a
priest
how
far
this
is
true
i
don
t
know
but
andrey
yefimitch
himself
has
more
than
once
confessed
that
he
has
never
had
a
natural
bent
for
medicine
or
science
in
general
however
that
may
have
been
when
he
finished
his
studies
in
the
medical
faculty
he
did
not
enter
the
priesthood
he
showed
no
special
devoutness
and
was
no
more
like
a
priest
at
the
beginning
of
his
medical
career
than
he
is
now
his
exterior
is
heavy
coarse
like
a
peasant
s
his
face
his
beard
his
flat
hair
and
his
coarse
clumsy
figure
suggest
an
overfed
intemperate
and
harsh
innkeeper
on
the
highroad
his
face
is
surly
looking
and
covered
with
blue
veins
his
eyes
are
little
and
his
nose
is
red
with
his
height
and
broad
shoulders
he
has
huge
hands
and
feet
one
would
think
that
a
blow
from
his
fist
would
knock
the
life
out
of
anyone
but
his
step
is
soft
and
his
walk
is
cautious
and
insinuating
when
he
meets
anyone
in
a
narrow
passage
he
is
always
the
first
to
stop
and
make
way
and
to
say
not
in
a
bass
as
one
would
expect
but
in
a
high
soft
tenor
i
beg
your
pardon
he
has
a
little
swelling
on
his
neck
which
prevents
him
from
wearing
stiff
starched
collars
and
so
he
always
goes
about
in
soft
linen
or
cotton
shirts
altogether
he
does
not
dress
like
a
doctor
he
wears
the
same
suit
for
ten
years
and
the
new
clothes
which
he
usually
buys
at
a
jewish
shop
look
as
shabby
and
crumpled
on
him
as
his
old
ones
he
sees
patients
and
dines
and
pays
visits
all
in
the
same
coat
but
this
is
not
due
to
niggardliness
but
to
complete
carelessness
about
his
appearance
when
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
town
to
take
up
his
duties
the
institution
founded
to
the
glory
of
god
was
in
a
terrible
condition
one
could
hardly
breathe
for
the
stench
in
the
wards
in
the
passages
and
in
the
courtyards
of
the
hospital
the
hospital
servants
the
nurses
and
their
children
slept
in
the
wards
together
with
the
patients
they
complained
that
there
was
no
living
for
beetles
bugs
and
mice
the
surgical
wards
were
never
free
from
erysipelas
there
were
only
two
scalpels
and
not
one
thermometer
in
the
whole
hospital
potatoes
were
kept
in
the
baths
the
superintendent
the
housekeeper
and
the
medical
assistant
robbed
the
patients
and
of
the
old
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
s
predecessor
people
declared
that
he
secretly
sold
the
hospital
alcohol
and
that
he
kept
a
regular
harem
consisting
of
nurses
and
female
patients
these
disorderly
proceedings
were
perfectly
well
known
in
the
town
and
were
even
exaggerated
but
people
took
them
calmly
some
justified
them
on
the
ground
that
there
were
only
peasants
and
working
men
in
the
hospital
who
could
not
be
dissatisfied
since
they
were
much
worse
off
at
home
than
in
the
hospital
they
couldn
t
be
fed
on
woodcocks
others
said
in
excuse
that
the
town
alone
without
help
from
the
zemstvo
was
not
equal
to
maintaining
a
good
hospital
thank
god
for
having
one
at
all
even
a
poor
one
and
the
newly
formed
zemstvo
did
not
open
infirmaries
either
in
the
town
or
the
neighbourhood
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
town
already
had
its
hospital
after
looking
over
the
hospital
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
an
immoral
institution
and
extremely
prejudicial
to
the
health
of
the
townspeople
in
his
opinion
the
most
sensible
thing
that
could
be
done
was
to
let
out
the
patients
and
close
the
hospital
but
he
reflected
that
his
will
alone
was
not
enough
to
do
this
and
that
it
would
be
useless
if
physical
and
moral
impurity
were
driven
out
of
one
place
they
would
only
move
to
another
one
must
wait
for
it
to
wither
away
of
itself
besides
if
people
open
a
hospital
and
put
up
with
having
it
it
must
be
because
they
need
it
superstition
and
all
the
nastiness
and
abominations
of
daily
life
were
necessary
since
in
process
of
time
they
worked
out
to
something
sensible
just
as
manure
turns
into
black
earth
there
was
nothing
on
earth
so
good
that
it
had
not
something
nasty
about
its
first
origin
when
andrey
yefimitch
undertook
his
duties
he
was
apparently
not
greatly
concerned
about
the
irregularities
at
the
hospital
he
only
asked
the
attendants
and
nurses
not
to
sleep
in
the
wards
and
had
two
cupboards
of
instruments
put
up
the
superintendent
the
housekeeper
the
medical
assistant
and
the
erysipelas
remained
unchanged
andrey
yefimitch
loved
intelligence
and
honesty
intensely
but
he
had
no
strength
of
will
nor
belief
in
his
right
to
organize
an
intelligent
and
honest
life
about
him
he
was
absolutely
unable
to
give
orders
to
forbid
things
and
to
insist
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
taken
a
vow
never
to
raise
his
voice
and
never
to
make
use
of
the
imperative
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
say
fetch
or
bring
when
he
wanted
his
meals
he
would
cough
hesitatingly
and
say
to
the
cook
how
about
tea
or
how
about
dinner
to
dismiss
the
superintendent
or
to
tell
him
to
leave
off
stealing
or
to
abolish
the
unnecessary
parasitic
post
altogether
was
absolutely
beyond
his
powers
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
deceived
or
flattered
or
accounts
he
knew
to
be
cooked
were
brought
him
to
sign
he
would
turn
as
red
as
a
crab
and
feel
guilty
but
yet
he
would
sign
the
accounts
when
the
patients
complained
to
him
of
being
hungry
or
of
the
roughness
of
the
nurses
he
would
be
confused
and
mutter
guiltily
very
well
very
well
i
will
go
into
it
later
most
likely
there
is
some
misunderstanding
at
first
andrey
yefimitch
worked
very
zealously
he
saw
patients
every
day
from
morning
till
dinner
time
performed
operations
and
even
attended
confinements
the
ladies
said
of
him
that
he
was
attentive
and
clever
at
diagnosing
diseases
especially
those
of
women
and
children
but
in
process
of
time
the
work
unmistakably
wearied
him
by
its
monotony
and
obvious
uselessness
to
day
one
sees
thirty
patients
and
to
morrow
they
have
increased
to
thirty
five
the
next
day
forty
and
so
on
from
day
to
day
from
year
to
year
while
the
mortality
in
the
town
did
not
decrease
and
the
patients
did
not
leave
off
coming
to
be
any
real
help
to
forty
patients
between
morning
and
dinner
was
not
physically
possible
so
it
could
but
lead
to
deception
if
twelve
thousand
patients
were
seen
in
a
year
it
meant
if
one
looked
at
it
simply
that
twelve
thousand
men
were
deceived
to
put
those
who
were
seriously
ill
into
wards
and
to
treat
them
according
to
the
principles
of
science
was
impossible
too
because
though
there
were
principles
there
was
no
science
if
he
were
to
put
aside
philosophy
and
pedantically
follow
the
rules
as
other
doctors
did
the
things
above
all
necessary
were
cleanliness
and
ventilation
instead
of
dirt
wholesome
nourishment
instead
of
broth
made
of
stinking
sour
cabbage
and
good
assistants
instead
of
thieves
and
indeed
why
hinder
people
dying
if
death
is
the
normal
and
legitimate
end
of
everyone
what
is
gained
if
some
shop
keeper
or
clerk
lives
an
extra
five
or
ten
years
if
the
aim
of
medicine
is
by
drugs
to
alleviate
suffering
the
question
forces
itself
on
one
why
alleviate
it
in
the
first
place
they
say
that
suffering
leads
man
to
perfection
and
in
the
second
if
mankind
really
learns
to
alleviate
its
sufferings
with
pills
and
drops
it
will
completely
abandon
religion
and
philosophy
in
which
it
has
hitherto
found
not
merely
protection
from
all
sorts
of
trouble
but
even
happiness
pushkin
suffered
terrible
agonies
before
his
death
poor
heine
lay
paralyzed
for
several
years
why
then
should
not
some
andrey
yefimitch
or
matryona
savishna
be
ill
since
their
lives
had
nothing
of
importance
in
them
and
would
have
been
entirely
empty
and
like
the
life
of
an
amoeba
except
for
suffering
oppressed
by
such
reflections
andrey
yefimitch
relaxed
his
efforts
and
gave
up
visiting
the
hospital
every
day
vi
his
life
was
passed
like
this
as
a
rule
he
got
up
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
dressed
and
drank
his
tea
then
he
sat
down
in
his
study
to
read
or
went
to
the
hospital
at
the
hospital
the
out
patients
were
sitting
in
the
dark
narrow
little
corridor
waiting
to
be
seen
by
the
doctor
the
nurses
and
the
attendants
tramping
with
their
boots
over
the
brick
floors
ran
by
them
gaunt
looking
patients
in
dressing
gowns
passed
dead
bodies
and
vessels
full
of
filth
were
carried
by
the
children
were
crying
and
there
was
a
cold
draught
andrey
yefimitch
knew
that
such
surroundings
were
torture
to
feverish
consumptive
and
impressionable
patients
but
what
could
be
done
in
the
consulting
room
he
was
met
by
his
assistant
sergey
sergeyitch
a
fat
little
man
with
a
plump
well
washed
shaven
face
with
soft
smooth
manners
wearing
a
new
loosely
cut
suit
and
looking
more
like
a
senator
than
a
medical
assistant
he
had
an
immense
practice
in
the
town
wore
a
white
tie
and
considered
himself
more
proficient
than
the
doctor
who
had
no
practice
in
the
corner
of
the
consulting
room
there
stood
a
large
ikon
in
a
shrine
with
a
heavy
lamp
in
front
of
it
and
near
it
a
candle
stand
with
a
white
cover
on
it
on
the
walls
hung
portraits
of
bishops
a
view
of
the
svyatogorsky
monastery
and
wreaths
of
dried
cornflowers
sergey
sergeyitch
was
religious
and
liked
solemnity
and
decorum
the
ikon
had
been
put
up
at
his
expense
at
his
instructions
some
one
of
the
patients
read
the
hymns
of
praise
in
the
consulting
room
on
sundays
and
after
the
reading
sergey
sergeyitch
himself
went
through
the
wards
with
a
censer
and
burned
incense
there
were
a
great
many
patients
but
the
time
was
short
and
so
the
work
was
confined
to
the
asking
of
a
few
brief
questions
and
the
administration
of
some
drugs
such
as
castor
oil
or
volatile
ointment
andrey
yefimitch
would
sit
with
his
cheek
resting
in
his
hand
lost
in
thought
and
asking
questions
mechanically
sergey
sergeyitch
sat
down
too
rubbing
his
hands
and
from
time
to
time
putting
in
his
word
we
suffer
pain
and
poverty
he
would
say
because
we
do
not
pray
to
the
merciful
god
as
we
should
yes
andrey
yefimitch
never
performed
any
operation
when
he
was
seeing
patients
he
had
long
ago
given
up
doing
so
and
the
sight
of
blood
upset
him
when
he
had
to
open
a
child
s
mouth
in
order
to
look
at
its
throat
and
the
child
cried
and
tried
to
defend
itself
with
its
little
hands
the
noise
in
his
ears
made
his
head
go
round
and
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
he
would
make
haste
to
prescribe
a
drug
and
motion
to
the
woman
to
take
the
child
away
he
was
soon
wearied
by
the
timidity
of
the
patients
and
their
incoherence
by
the
proximity
of
the
pious
sergey
sergeyitch
by
the
portraits
on
the
walls
and
by
his
own
questions
which
he
had
asked
over
and
over
again
for
twenty
years
and
he
would
go
away
after
seeing
five
or
six
patients
the
rest
would
be
seen
by
his
assistant
in
his
absence
with
the
agreeable
thought
that
thank
god
he
had
no
private
practice
now
and
that
no
one
would
interrupt
him
andrey
yefimitch
sat
down
to
the
table
immediately
on
reaching
home
and
took
up
a
book
he
read
a
great
deal
and
always
with
enjoyment
half
his
salary
went
on
buying
books
and
of
the
six
rooms
that
made
up
his
abode
three
were
heaped
up
with
books
and
old
magazines
he
liked
best
of
all
works
on
history
and
philosophy
the
only
medical
publication
to
which
he
subscribed
was
the
doctor
of
which
he
always
read
the
last
pages
first
he
would
always
go
on
reading
for
several
hours
without
a
break
and
without
being
weary
he
did
not
read
as
rapidly
and
impulsively
as
ivan
dmitritch
had
done
in
the
past
but
slowly
and
with
concentration
often
pausing
over
a
passage
which
he
liked
or
did
not
find
intelligible
near
the
books
there
always
stood
a
decanter
of
vodka
and
a
salted
cucumber
or
a
pickled
apple
lay
beside
it
not
on
a
plate
but
on
the
baize
table
cloth
every
half
hour
he
would
pour
himself
out
a
glass
of
vodka
and
drink
it
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
book
then
without
looking
at
it
he
would
feel
for
the
cucumber
and
bite
off
a
bit
at
three
o
clock
he
would
go
cautiously
to
the
kitchen
door
cough
and
say
daryushka
what
about
dinner
after
his
dinner
a
rather
poor
and
untidily
served
one
andrey
yefimitch
would
walk
up
and
down
his
rooms
with
his
arms
folded
thinking
the
clock
would
strike
four
then
five
and
still
he
would
be
walking
up
and
down
thinking
occasionally
the
kitchen
door
would
creak
and
the
red
and
sleepy
face
of
daryushka
would
appear
andrey
yefimitch
isn
t
it
time
for
you
to
have
your
beer
she
would
ask
anxiously
no
it
s
not
time
yet
he
would
answer
i
ll
wait
a
little
i
ll
wait
a
little
towards
the
evening
the
postmaster
mihail
averyanitch
the
only
man
in
town
whose
society
did
not
bore
andrey
yefimitch
would
come
in
mihail
averyanitch
had
once
been
a
very
rich
landowner
and
had
served
in
the
calvary
but
had
come
to
ruin
and
was
forced
by
poverty
to
take
a
job
in
the
post
office
late
in
life
he
had
a
hale
and
hearty
appearance
luxuriant
grey
whiskers
the
manners
of
a
well
bred
man
and
a
loud
pleasant
voice
he
was
good
natured
and
emotional
but
hot
tempered
when
anyone
in
the
post
office
made
a
protest
expressed
disagreement
or
even
began
to
argue
mihail
averyanitch
would
turn
crimson
shake
all
over
and
shout
in
a
voice
of
thunder
hold
your
tongue
so
that
the
post
office
had
long
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
an
institution
which
it
was
terrible
to
visit
mihail
averyanitch
liked
and
respected
andrey
yefimitch
for
his
culture
and
the
loftiness
of
his
soul
he
treated
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
town
superciliously
as
though
they
were
his
subordinates
here
i
am
he
would
say
going
in
to
andrey
yefimitch
good
evening
my
dear
fellow
i
ll
be
bound
you
are
getting
sick
of
me
aren
t
you
on
the
contrary
i
am
delighted
said
the
doctor
i
am
always
glad
to
see
you
the
friends
would
sit
on
the
sofa
in
the
study
and
for
some
time
would
smoke
in
silence
daryushka
what
about
the
beer
andrey
yefimitch
would
say
they
would
drink
their
first
bottle
still
in
silence
the
doctor
brooding
and
mihail
averyanitch
with
a
gay
and
animated
face
like
a
man
who
has
something
very
interesting
to
tell
the
doctor
was
always
the
one
to
begin
the
conversation
what
a
pity
he
would
say
quietly
and
slowly
not
looking
his
friend
in
the
face
he
never
looked
anyone
in
the
face
what
a
great
pity
it
is
that
there
are
no
people
in
our
town
who
are
capable
of
carrying
on
intelligent
and
interesting
conversation
or
care
to
do
so
it
is
an
immense
privation
for
us
even
the
educated
class
do
not
rise
above
vulgarity
the
level
of
their
development
i
assure
you
is
not
a
bit
higher
than
that
of
the
lower
orders
perfectly
true
i
agree
you
know
of
course
the
doctor
went
on
quietly
and
deliberately
that
everything
in
this
world
is
insignificant
and
uninteresting
except
the
higher
spiritual
manifestations
of
the
human
mind
intellect
draws
a
sharp
line
between
the
animals
and
man
suggests
the
divinity
of
the
latter
and
to
some
extent
even
takes
the
place
of
the
immortality
which
does
not
exist
consequently
the
intellect
is
the
only
possible
source
of
enjoyment
we
see
and
hear
of
no
trace
of
intellect
about
us
so
we
are
deprived
of
enjoyment
we
have
books
it
is
true
but
that
is
not
at
all
the
same
as
living
talk
and
converse
if
you
will
allow
me
to
make
a
not
quite
apt
comparison
books
are
the
printed
score
while
talk
is
the
singing
perfectly
true
a
silence
would
follow
daryushka
would
come
out
of
the
kitchen
and
with
an
expression
of
blank
dejection
would
stand
in
the
doorway
to
listen
with
her
face
propped
on
her
fist
eh
mihail
averyanitch
would
sigh
to
expect
intelligence
of
this
generation
and
he
would
describe
how
wholesome
entertaining
and
interesting
life
had
been
in
the
past
how
intelligent
the
educated
class
in
russia
used
to
be
and
what
lofty
ideas
it
had
of
honour
and
friendship
how
they
used
to
lend
money
without
an
iou
and
it
was
thought
a
disgrace
not
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
a
comrade
in
need
and
what
campaigns
what
adventures
what
skirmishes
what
comrades
what
women
and
the
caucasus
what
a
marvellous
country
the
wife
of
a
battalion
commander
a
queer
woman
used
to
put
on
an
officer
s
uniform
and
drive
off
into
the
mountains
in
the
evening
alone
without
a
guide
it
was
said
that
she
had
a
love
affair
with
some
princeling
in
the
native
village
queen
of
heaven
holy
mother
daryushka
would
sigh
and
how
we
drank
and
how
we
ate
and
what
desperate
liberals
we
were
andrey
yefimitch
would
listen
without
hearing
he
was
musing
as
he
sipped
his
beer
i
often
dream
of
intellectual
people
and
conversation
with
them
he
said
suddenly
interrupting
mihail
averyanitch
my
father
gave
me
an
excellent
education
but
under
the
influence
of
the
ideas
of
the
sixties
made
me
become
a
doctor
i
believe
if
i
had
not
obeyed
him
then
by
now
i
should
have
been
in
the
very
centre
of
the
intellectual
movement
most
likely
i
should
have
become
a
member
of
some
university
of
course
intellect
too
is
transient
and
not
eternal
but
you
know
why
i
cherish
a
partiality
for
it
life
is
a
vexatious
trap
when
a
thinking
man
reaches
maturity
and
attains
to
full
consciousness
he
can
not
help
feeling
that
he
is
in
a
trap
from
which
there
is
no
escape
indeed
he
is
summoned
without
his
choice
by
fortuitous
circumstances
from
non
existence
into
life
what
for
he
tries
to
find
out
the
meaning
and
object
of
his
existence
he
is
told
nothing
or
he
is
told
absurdities
he
knocks
and
it
is
not
opened
to
him
death
comes
to
him
also
without
his
choice
and
so
just
as
in
prison
men
held
together
by
common
misfortune
feel
more
at
ease
when
they
are
together
so
one
does
not
notice
the
trap
in
life
when
people
with
a
bent
for
analysis
and
generalization
meet
together
and
pass
their
time
in
the
interchange
of
proud
and
free
ideas
in
that
sense
the
intellect
is
the
source
of
an
enjoyment
nothing
can
replace
perfectly
true
not
looking
his
friend
in
the
face
andrey
yefimitch
would
go
on
quietly
and
with
pauses
talking
about
intellectual
people
and
conversation
with
them
and
mihail
averyanitch
would
listen
attentively
and
agree
perfectly
true
and
you
do
not
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
would
ask
suddenly
no
honoured
mihail
averyanitch
i
do
not
believe
it
and
have
no
grounds
for
believing
it
i
must
own
i
doubt
it
too
and
yet
i
have
a
feeling
as
though
i
should
never
die
oh
i
think
to
myself
old
fogey
it
is
time
you
were
dead
but
there
is
a
little
voice
in
my
soul
says
don
t
believe
it
you
won
t
die
soon
after
nine
o
clock
mihail
averyanitch
would
go
away
as
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
in
the
entry
he
would
say
with
a
sigh
what
a
wilderness
fate
has
carried
us
to
though
really
what
s
most
vexatious
of
all
is
to
have
to
die
here
ech
vii
after
seeing
his
friend
out
andrey
yefimitch
would
sit
down
at
the
table
and
begin
reading
again
the
stillness
of
the
evening
and
afterwards
of
the
night
was
not
broken
by
a
single
sound
and
it
seemed
as
though
time
were
standing
still
and
brooding
with
the
doctor
over
the
book
and
as
though
there
were
nothing
in
existence
but
the
books
and
the
lamp
with
the
green
shade
the
doctor
s
coarse
peasant
like
face
was
gradually
lighted
up
by
a
smile
of
delight
and
enthusiasm
over
the
progress
of
the
human
intellect
oh
why
is
not
man
immortal
he
thought
what
is
the
good
of
the
brain
centres
and
convolutions
what
is
the
good
of
sight
speech
self
consciousness
genius
if
it
is
all
destined
to
depart
into
the
soil
and
in
the
end
to
grow
cold
together
with
the
earth
s
crust
and
then
for
millions
of
years
to
fly
with
the
earth
round
the
sun
with
no
meaning
and
no
object
to
do
that
there
was
no
need
at
all
to
draw
man
with
his
lofty
almost
godlike
intellect
out
of
non
existence
and
then
as
though
in
mockery
to
turn
him
into
clay
the
transmutation
of
substances
but
what
cowardice
to
comfort
oneself
with
that
cheap
substitute
for
immortality
the
unconscious
processes
that
take
place
in
nature
are
lower
even
than
the
stupidity
of
man
since
in
stupidity
there
is
anyway
consciousness
and
will
while
in
those
processes
there
is
absolutely
nothing
only
the
coward
who
has
more
fear
of
death
than
dignity
can
comfort
himself
with
the
fact
that
his
body
will
in
time
live
again
in
the
grass
in
the
stones
in
the
toad
to
find
one
s
immortality
in
the
transmutation
of
substances
is
as
strange
as
to
prophesy
a
brilliant
future
for
the
case
after
a
precious
violin
has
been
broken
and
become
useless
when
the
clock
struck
andrey
yefimitch
would
sink
back
into
his
chair
and
close
his
eyes
to
think
a
little
and
under
the
influence
of
the
fine
ideas
of
which
he
had
been
reading
he
would
unawares
recall
his
past
and
his
present
the
past
was
hateful
better
not
to
think
of
it
and
it
was
the
same
in
the
present
as
in
the
past
he
knew
that
at
the
very
time
when
his
thoughts
were
floating
together
with
the
cooling
earth
round
the
sun
in
the
main
building
beside
his
abode
people
were
suffering
in
sickness
and
physical
impurity
someone
perhaps
could
not
sleep
and
was
making
war
upon
the
insects
someone
was
being
infected
by
erysipelas
or
moaning
over
too
tight
a
bandage
perhaps
the
patients
were
playing
cards
with
the
nurses
and
drinking
vodka
according
to
the
yearly
return
twelve
thousand
people
had
been
deceived
the
whole
hospital
rested
as
it
had
done
twenty
years
ago
on
thieving
filth
scandals
gossip
on
gross
quackery
and
as
before
it
was
an
immoral
institution
extremely
injurious
to
the
health
of
the
inhabitants
he
knew
that
nikita
knocked
the
patients
about
behind
the
barred
windows
of
ward
no
6
and
that
moiseika
went
about
the
town
every
day
begging
alms
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
very
well
that
a
magical
change
had
taken
place
in
medicine
during
the
last
twenty
five
years
when
he
was
studying
at
the
university
he
had
fancied
that
medicine
would
soon
be
overtaken
by
the
fate
of
alchemy
and
metaphysics
but
now
when
he
was
reading
at
night
the
science
of
medicine
touched
him
and
excited
his
wonder
and
even
enthusiasm
what
unexpected
brilliance
what
a
revolution
thanks
to
the
antiseptic
system
operations
were
performed
such
as
the
great
pirogov
had
considered
impossible
even
in
spe
ordinary
zemstvo
doctors
were
venturing
to
perform
the
resection
of
the
kneecap
of
abdominal
operations
only
one
per
cent
was
fatal
while
stone
was
considered
such
a
trifle
that
they
did
not
even
write
about
it
a
radical
cure
for
syphilis
had
been
discovered
and
the
theory
of
heredity
hypnotism
the
discoveries
of
pasteur
and
of
koch
hygiene
based
on
statistics
and
the
work
of
zemstvo
doctors
psychiatry
with
its
modern
classification
of
mental
diseases
methods
of
diagnosis
and
treatment
was
a
perfect
elborus
in
comparison
with
what
had
been
in
the
past
they
no
longer
poured
cold
water
on
the
heads
of
lunatics
nor
put
strait
waistcoats
upon
them
they
treated
them
with
humanity
and
even
so
it
was
stated
in
the
papers
got
up
balls
and
entertainments
for
them
andrey
yefimitch
knew
that
with
modern
tastes
and
views
such
an
abomination
as
ward
no
6
was
possible
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
a
railway
in
a
little
town
where
the
mayor
and
all
the
town
council
were
half
illiterate
tradesmen
who
looked
upon
the
doctor
as
an
oracle
who
must
be
believed
without
any
criticism
even
if
he
had
poured
molten
lead
into
their
mouths
in
any
other
place
the
public
and
the
newspapers
would
long
ago
have
torn
this
little
bastille
to
pieces
but
after
all
what
of
it
andrey
yefimitch
would
ask
himself
opening
his
eyes
there
is
the
antiseptic
system
there
is
koch
there
is
pasteur
but
the
essential
reality
is
not
altered
a
bit
ill
health
and
mortality
are
still
the
same
they
get
up
balls
and
entertainments
for
the
mad
but
still
they
don
t
let
them
go
free
so
it
s
all
nonsense
and
vanity
and
there
is
no
difference
in
reality
between
the
best
vienna
clinic
and
my
hospital
but
depression
and
a
feeling
akin
to
envy
prevented
him
from
feeling
indifferent
it
must
have
been
owing
to
exhaustion
his
heavy
head
sank
on
to
the
book
he
put
his
hands
under
his
face
to
make
it
softer
and
thought
i
serve
in
a
pernicious
institution
and
receive
a
salary
from
people
whom
i
am
deceiving
i
am
not
honest
but
then
i
of
myself
am
nothing
i
am
only
part
of
an
inevitable
social
evil
all
local
officials
are
pernicious
and
receive
their
salary
for
doing
nothing
and
so
for
my
dishonesty
it
is
not
i
who
am
to
blame
but
the
times
if
i
had
been
born
two
hundred
years
later
i
should
have
been
different
when
it
struck
three
he
would
put
out
his
lamp
and
go
into
his
bedroom
he
was
not
sleepy
viii
two
years
before
the
zemstvo
in
a
liberal
mood
had
decided
to
allow
three
hundred
roubles
a
year
to
pay
for
additional
medical
service
in
the
town
till
the
zemstvo
hospital
should
be
opened
and
the
district
doctor
yevgeny
fyodoritch
hobotov
was
invited
to
the
town
to
assist
andrey
yefimitch
he
was
a
very
young
man
not
yet
thirty
tall
and
dark
with
broad
cheek
bones
and
little
eyes
his
forefathers
had
probably
come
from
one
of
the
many
alien
races
of
russia
he
arrived
in
the
town
without
a
farthing
with
a
small
portmanteau
and
a
plain
young
woman
whom
he
called
his
cook
this
woman
had
a
baby
at
the
breast
yevgeny
fyodoritch
used
to
go
about
in
a
cap
with
a
peak
and
in
high
boots
and
in
the
winter
wore
a
sheepskin
he
made
great
friends
with
sergey
sergeyitch
the
medical
assistant
and
with
the
treasurer
but
held
aloof
from
the
other
officials
and
for
some
reason
called
them
aristocrats
he
had
only
one
book
in
his
lodgings
the
latest
prescriptions
of
the
vienna
clinic
for
1881
when
he
went
to
a
patient
he
always
took
this
book
with
him
he
played
billiards
in
the
evening
at
the
club
he
did
not
like
cards
he
was
very
fond
of
using
in
conversation
such
expressions
as
endless
bobbery
canting
soft
soap
shut
up
with
your
finicking
he
visited
the
hospital
twice
a
week
made
the
round
of
the
wards
and
saw
out
patients
the
complete
absence
of
antiseptic
treatment
and
the
cupping
roused
his
indignation
but
he
did
not
introduce
any
new
system
being
afraid
of
offending
andrey
yefimitch
he
regarded
his
colleague
as
a
sly
old
rascal
suspected
him
of
being
a
man
of
large
means
and
secretly
envied
him
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
his
post
ix
on
a
spring
evening
towards
the
end
of
march
when
there
was
no
snow
left
on
the
ground
and
the
starlings
were
singing
in
the
hospital
garden
the
doctor
went
out
to
see
his
friend
the
postmaster
as
far
as
the
gate
at
that
very
moment
the
jew
moiseika
returning
with
his
booty
came
into
the
yard
he
had
no
cap
on
and
his
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
goloshes
in
his
hand
he
had
a
little
bag
of
coppers
give
me
a
kopeck
he
said
to
the
doctor
smiling
and
shivering
with
cold
andrey
yefimitch
who
could
never
refuse
anyone
anything
gave
him
a
ten
kopeck
piece
how
bad
that
is
he
thought
looking
at
the
jew
s
bare
feet
with
their
thin
red
ankles
why
it
s
wet
and
stirred
by
a
feeling
akin
both
to
pity
and
disgust
he
went
into
the
lodge
behind
the
jew
looking
now
at
his
bald
head
now
at
his
ankles
as
the
doctor
went
in
nikita
jumped
up
from
his
heap
of
litter
and
stood
at
attention
good
day
nikita
andrey
yefimitch
said
mildly
that
jew
should
be
provided
with
boots
or
something
he
will
catch
cold
certainly
your
honour
i
ll
inform
the
superintendent
please
do
ask
him
in
my
name
tell
him
that
i
asked
the
door
into
the
ward
was
open
ivan
dmitritch
lying
propped
on
his
elbow
on
the
bed
listened
in
alarm
to
the
unfamiliar
voice
and
suddenly
recognized
the
doctor
he
trembled
all
over
with
anger
jumped
up
and
with
a
red
and
wrathful
face
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
ran
out
into
the
middle
of
the
road
the
doctor
has
come
he
shouted
and
broke
into
a
laugh
at
last
gentlemen
i
congratulate
you
the
doctor
is
honouring
us
with
a
visit
cursed
reptile
he
shrieked
and
stamped
in
a
frenzy
such
as
had
never
been
seen
in
the
ward
before
kill
the
reptile
no
killing
s
too
good
drown
him
in
the
midden
pit
andrey
yefimitch
hearing
this
looked
into
the
ward
from
the
entry
and
asked
gently
what
for
what
for
shouted
ivan
dmitritch
going
up
to
him
with
a
menacing
air
and
convulsively
wrapping
himself
in
his
dressing
gown
what
for
thief
he
said
with
a
look
of
repulsion
moving
his
lips
as
though
he
would
spit
at
him
quack
hangman
calm
yourself
said
andrey
yefimitch
smiling
guiltily
i
assure
you
i
have
never
stolen
anything
and
as
to
the
rest
most
likely
you
greatly
exaggerate
i
see
you
are
angry
with
me
calm
yourself
i
beg
if
you
can
and
tell
me
coolly
what
are
you
angry
for
what
are
you
keeping
me
here
for
because
you
are
ill
yes
i
am
ill
but
you
know
dozens
hundreds
of
madmen
are
walking
about
in
freedom
because
your
ignorance
is
incapable
of
distinguishing
them
from
the
sane
why
am
i
and
these
poor
wretches
to
be
shut
up
here
like
scapegoats
for
all
the
rest
you
your
assistant
the
superintendent
and
all
your
hospital
rabble
are
immeasurably
inferior
to
every
one
of
us
morally
why
then
are
we
shut
up
and
you
not
where
s
the
logic
of
it
morality
and
logic
don
t
come
in
it
all
depends
on
chance
if
anyone
is
shut
up
he
has
to
stay
and
if
anyone
is
not
shut
up
he
can
walk
about
that
s
all
there
is
neither
morality
nor
logic
in
my
being
a
doctor
and
your
being
a
mental
patient
there
is
nothing
but
idle
chance
that
twaddle
i
don
t
understand
ivan
dmitritch
brought
out
in
a
hollow
voice
and
he
sat
down
on
his
bed
moiseika
whom
nikita
did
not
venture
to
search
in
the
presence
of
the
doctor
laid
out
on
his
bed
pieces
of
bread
bits
of
paper
and
little
bones
and
still
shivering
with
cold
began
rapidly
in
a
singsong
voice
saying
something
in
yiddish
he
most
likely
imagined
that
he
had
opened
a
shop
let
me
out
said
ivan
dmitritch
and
his
voice
quivered
i
can
not
but
why
why
because
it
is
not
in
my
power
think
what
use
will
it
be
to
you
if
i
do
let
you
out
go
the
townspeople
or
the
police
will
detain
you
or
bring
you
back
yes
yes
that
s
true
said
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
rubbed
his
forehead
it
s
awful
but
what
am
i
to
do
what
andrey
yefimitch
liked
ivan
dmitritch
s
voice
and
his
intelligent
young
face
with
its
grimaces
he
longed
to
be
kind
to
the
young
man
and
soothe
him
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
him
thought
and
said
you
ask
me
what
to
do
the
very
best
thing
in
your
position
would
be
to
run
away
but
unhappily
that
is
useless
you
would
be
taken
up
when
society
protects
itself
from
the
criminal
mentally
deranged
or
otherwise
inconvenient
people
it
is
invincible
there
is
only
one
thing
left
for
you
to
resign
yourself
to
the
thought
that
your
presence
here
is
inevitable
it
is
no
use
to
anyone
so
long
as
prisons
and
madhouses
exist
someone
must
be
shut
up
in
them
if
not
you
i
if
not
i
some
third
person
wait
till
in
the
distant
future
prisons
and
madhouses
no
longer
exist
and
there
will
be
neither
bars
on
the
windows
nor
hospital
gowns
of
course
that
time
will
come
sooner
or
later
ivan
dmitritch
smiled
ironically
you
are
jesting
he
said
screwing
up
his
eyes
such
gentlemen
as
you
and
your
assistant
nikita
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
future
but
you
may
be
sure
sir
better
days
will
come
i
may
express
myself
cheaply
you
may
laugh
but
the
dawn
of
a
new
life
is
at
hand
truth
and
justice
will
triumph
and
our
turn
will
come
i
shall
not
live
to
see
it
i
shall
perish
but
some
people
s
great
grandsons
will
see
it
i
greet
them
with
all
my
heart
and
rejoice
rejoice
with
them
onward
god
be
your
help
friends
with
shining
eyes
ivan
dmitritch
got
up
and
stretching
his
hands
towards
the
window
went
on
with
emotion
in
his
voice
from
behind
these
bars
i
bless
you
hurrah
for
truth
and
justice
i
rejoice
i
see
no
particular
reason
to
rejoice
said
andrey
yefimitch
who
thought
ivan
dmitritch
s
movement
theatrical
though
he
was
delighted
by
it
prisons
and
madhouses
there
will
not
be
and
truth
as
you
have
just
expressed
it
will
triumph
but
the
reality
of
things
you
know
will
not
change
the
laws
of
nature
will
still
remain
the
same
people
will
suffer
pain
grow
old
and
die
just
as
they
do
now
however
magnificent
a
dawn
lighted
up
your
life
you
would
yet
in
the
end
be
nailed
up
in
a
coffin
and
thrown
into
a
hole
and
immortality
oh
come
now
you
don
t
believe
in
it
but
i
do
somebody
in
dostoevsky
or
voltaire
said
that
if
there
had
not
been
a
god
men
would
have
invented
him
and
i
firmly
believe
that
if
there
is
no
immortality
the
great
intellect
of
man
will
sooner
or
later
invent
it
well
said
observed
andrey
yefimitch
smiling
with
pleasure
its
a
good
thing
you
have
faith
with
such
a
belief
one
may
live
happily
even
shut
up
within
walls
you
have
studied
somewhere
i
presume
yes
i
have
been
at
the
university
but
did
not
complete
my
studies
you
are
a
reflecting
and
a
thoughtful
man
in
any
surroundings
you
can
find
tranquillity
in
yourself
free
and
deep
thinking
which
strives
for
the
comprehension
of
life
and
complete
contempt
for
the
foolish
bustle
of
the
world
those
are
two
blessings
beyond
any
that
man
has
ever
known
and
you
can
possess
them
even
though
you
lived
behind
threefold
bars
diogenes
lived
in
a
tub
yet
he
was
happier
than
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
your
diogenes
was
a
blockhead
said
ivan
dmitritch
morosely
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
diogenes
and
some
foolish
comprehension
of
life
he
cried
growing
suddenly
angry
and
leaping
up
i
love
life
i
love
it
passionately
i
have
the
mania
of
persecution
a
continual
agonizing
terror
but
i
have
moments
when
i
am
overwhelmed
by
the
thirst
for
life
and
then
i
am
afraid
of
going
mad
i
want
dreadfully
to
live
dreadfully
he
walked
up
and
down
the
ward
in
agitation
and
said
dropping
his
voice
when
i
dream
i
am
haunted
by
phantoms
people
come
to
me
i
hear
voices
and
music
and
i
fancy
i
am
walking
through
woods
or
by
the
seashore
and
i
long
so
passionately
for
movement
for
interests
come
tell
me
what
news
is
there
asked
ivan
dmitritch
what
s
happening
do
you
wish
to
know
about
the
town
or
in
general
well
tell
me
first
about
the
town
and
then
in
general
well
in
the
town
it
is
appallingly
dull
there
s
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
no
one
to
listen
to
there
are
no
new
people
a
young
doctor
called
hobotov
has
come
here
recently
he
had
come
in
my
time
well
he
is
a
low
cad
isn
t
he
yes
he
is
a
man
of
no
culture
it
s
strange
you
know
judging
by
every
sign
there
is
no
intellectual
stagnation
in
our
capital
cities
there
is
a
movement
so
there
must
be
real
people
there
too
but
for
some
reason
they
always
send
us
such
men
as
i
would
rather
not
see
it
s
an
unlucky
town
yes
it
is
an
unlucky
town
sighed
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
laughed
and
how
are
things
in
general
what
are
they
writing
in
the
papers
and
reviews
it
was
by
now
dark
in
the
ward
the
doctor
got
up
and
standing
began
to
describe
what
was
being
written
abroad
and
in
russia
and
the
tendency
of
thought
that
could
be
noticed
now
ivan
dmitritch
listened
attentively
and
put
questions
but
suddenly
as
though
recalling
something
terrible
clutched
at
his
head
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
with
his
back
to
the
doctor
what
s
the
matter
asked
andrey
yefimitch
you
will
not
hear
another
word
from
me
said
ivan
dmitritch
rudely
leave
me
alone
why
so
i
tell
you
leave
me
alone
why
the
devil
do
you
persist
andrey
yefimitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
heaved
a
sigh
and
went
out
as
he
crossed
the
entry
he
said
you
might
clear
up
here
nikita
there
s
an
awfully
stuffy
smell
certainly
your
honour
what
an
agreeable
young
man
thought
andrey
yefimitch
going
back
to
his
flat
in
all
the
years
i
have
been
living
here
i
do
believe
he
is
the
first
i
have
met
with
whom
one
can
talk
he
is
capable
of
reasoning
and
is
interested
in
just
the
right
things
while
he
was
reading
and
afterwards
while
he
was
going
to
bed
he
kept
thinking
about
ivan
dmitritch
and
when
he
woke
next
morning
he
remembered
that
he
had
the
day
before
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
intelligent
and
interesting
man
and
determined
to
visit
him
again
as
soon
as
possible
x
ivan
dmitritch
was
lying
in
the
same
position
as
on
the
previous
day
with
his
head
clutched
in
both
hands
and
his
legs
drawn
up
his
face
was
not
visible
good
day
my
friend
said
andrey
yefimitch
you
are
not
asleep
are
you
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
your
friend
ivan
dmitritch
articulated
into
the
pillow
and
in
the
second
your
efforts
are
useless
you
will
not
get
one
word
out
of
me
strange
muttered
andrey
yefimitch
in
confusion
yesterday
we
talked
peacefully
but
suddenly
for
some
reason
you
took
offence
and
broke
off
all
at
once
probably
i
expressed
myself
awkwardly
or
perhaps
gave
utterance
to
some
idea
which
did
not
fit
in
with
your
convictions
yes
a
likely
idea
said
ivan
dmitritch
sitting
up
and
looking
at
the
doctor
with
irony
and
uneasiness
his
eyes
were
red
you
can
go
and
spy
and
probe
somewhere
else
it
s
no
use
your
doing
it
here
i
knew
yesterday
what
you
had
come
for
a
strange
fancy
laughed
the
doctor
so
you
suppose
me
to
be
a
spy
yes
i
do
a
spy
or
a
doctor
who
has
been
charged
to
test
me
it
s
all
the
same
oh
excuse
me
what
a
queer
fellow
you
are
really
the
doctor
sat
down
on
the
stool
near
the
bed
and
shook
his
head
reproachfully
but
let
us
suppose
you
are
right
he
said
let
us
suppose
that
i
am
treacherously
trying
to
trap
you
into
saying
something
so
as
to
betray
you
to
the
police
you
would
be
arrested
and
then
tried
but
would
you
be
any
worse
off
being
tried
and
in
prison
than
you
are
here
if
you
are
banished
to
a
settlement
or
even
sent
to
penal
servitude
would
it
be
worse
than
being
shut
up
in
this
ward
i
imagine
it
would
be
no
worse
what
then
are
you
afraid
of
these
words
evidently
had
an
effect
on
ivan
dmitritch
he
sat
down
quietly
it
was
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
the
time
when
andrey
yefimitch
usually
walked
up
and
down
his
rooms
and
daryushka
asked
whether
it
was
not
time
for
his
beer
it
was
a
still
bright
day
i
came
out
for
a
walk
after
dinner
and
here
i
have
come
as
you
see
said
the
doctor
it
is
quite
spring
what
month
is
it
march
asked
ivan
dmitritch
yes
the
end
of
march
is
it
very
muddy
no
not
very
there
are
already
paths
in
the
garden
it
would
be
nice
now
to
drive
in
an
open
carriage
somewhere
into
the
country
said
ivan
dmitritch
rubbing
his
red
eyes
as
though
he
were
just
awake
then
to
come
home
to
a
warm
snug
study
and
and
to
have
a
decent
doctor
to
cure
one
s
headache
it
s
so
long
since
i
have
lived
like
a
human
being
it
s
disgusting
here
insufferably
disgusting
after
his
excitement
of
the
previous
day
he
was
exhausted
and
listless
and
spoke
unwillingly
his
fingers
twitched
and
from
his
face
it
could
be
seen
that
he
had
a
splitting
headache
there
is
no
real
difference
between
a
warm
snug
study
and
this
ward
said
andrey
yefimitch
a
man
s
peace
and
contentment
do
not
lie
outside
a
man
but
in
himself
what
do
you
mean
the
ordinary
man
looks
for
good
and
evil
in
external
things
that
is
in
carriages
in
studies
but
a
thinking
man
looks
for
it
in
himself
you
should
go
and
preach
that
philosophy
in
greece
where
it
s
warm
and
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
pomegranates
but
here
it
is
not
suited
to
the
climate
with
whom
was
it
i
was
talking
of
diogenes
was
it
with
you
yes
with
me
yesterday
diogenes
did
not
need
a
study
or
a
warm
habitation
it
s
hot
there
without
you
can
lie
in
your
tub
and
eat
oranges
and
olives
but
bring
him
to
russia
to
live
he
d
be
begging
to
be
let
indoors
in
may
let
alone
december
he
d
be
doubled
up
with
the
cold
no
one
can
be
insensible
to
cold
as
to
every
other
pain
marcus
aurelius
says
a
pain
is
a
vivid
idea
of
pain
make
an
effort
of
will
to
change
that
idea
dismiss
it
cease
to
complain
and
the
pain
will
disappear
that
is
true
the
wise
man
or
simply
the
reflecting
thoughtful
man
is
distinguished
precisely
by
his
contempt
for
suffering
he
is
always
contented
and
surprised
at
nothing
then
i
am
an
idiot
since
i
suffer
and
am
discontented
and
surprised
at
the
baseness
of
mankind
you
are
wrong
in
that
if
you
will
reflect
more
on
the
subject
you
will
understand
how
insignificant
is
all
that
external
world
that
agitates
us
one
must
strive
for
the
comprehension
of
life
and
in
that
is
true
happiness
comprehension
repeated
ivan
dmitritch
frowning
external
internal
excuse
me
but
i
don
t
understand
it
i
only
know
he
said
getting
up
and
looking
angrily
at
the
doctor
i
only
know
that
god
has
created
me
of
warm
blood
and
nerves
yes
indeed
if
organic
tissue
is
capable
of
life
it
must
react
to
every
stimulus
and
i
do
to
pain
i
respond
with
tears
and
outcries
to
baseness
with
indignation
to
filth
with
loathing
to
my
mind
that
is
just
what
is
called
life
the
lower
the
organism
the
less
sensitive
it
is
and
the
more
feebly
it
reacts
to
stimulus
and
the
higher
it
is
the
more
responsively
and
vigorously
it
reacts
to
reality
how
is
it
you
don
t
know
that
a
doctor
and
not
know
such
trifles
to
despise
suffering
to
be
always
contented
and
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
one
must
reach
this
condition
and
ivan
dmitritch
pointed
to
the
peasant
who
was
a
mass
of
fat
or
to
harden
oneself
by
suffering
to
such
a
point
that
one
loses
all
sensibility
to
it
that
is
in
other
words
to
cease
to
live
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
not
a
sage
or
a
philosopher
ivan
dmitritch
continued
with
irritation
and
i
don
t
understand
anything
about
it
i
am
not
capable
of
reasoning
on
the
contrary
your
reasoning
is
excellent
the
stoics
whom
you
are
parodying
were
remarkable
people
but
their
doctrine
crystallized
two
thousand
years
ago
and
has
not
advanced
and
will
not
advance
an
inch
forward
since
it
is
not
practical
or
living
it
had
a
success
only
with
the
minority
which
spends
its
life
in
savouring
all
sorts
of
theories
and
ruminating
over
them
the
majority
did
not
understand
it
a
doctrine
which
advocates
indifference
to
wealth
and
to
the
comforts
of
life
and
a
contempt
for
suffering
and
death
is
quite
unintelligible
to
the
vast
majority
of
men
since
that
majority
has
never
known
wealth
or
the
comforts
of
life
and
to
despise
suffering
would
mean
to
it
despising
life
itself
since
the
whole
existence
of
man
is
made
up
of
the
sensations
of
hunger
cold
injury
and
a
hamlet
like
dread
of
death
the
whole
of
life
lies
in
these
sensations
one
may
be
oppressed
by
it
one
may
hate
it
but
one
can
not
despise
it
yes
so
i
repeat
the
doctrine
of
the
stoics
can
never
have
a
future
from
the
beginning
of
time
up
to
to
day
you
see
continually
increasing
the
struggle
the
sensibility
to
pain
the
capacity
of
responding
to
stimulus
ivan
dmitritch
suddenly
lost
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
stopped
and
rubbed
his
forehead
with
vexation
i
meant
to
say
something
important
but
i
have
lost
it
he
said
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
this
is
what
i
mean
one
of
the
stoics
sold
himself
into
slavery
to
redeem
his
neighbour
so
you
see
even
a
stoic
did
react
to
stimulus
since
for
such
a
generous
act
as
the
destruction
of
oneself
for
the
sake
of
one
s
neighbour
he
must
have
had
a
soul
capable
of
pity
and
indignation
here
in
prison
i
have
forgotten
everything
i
have
learned
or
else
i
could
have
recalled
something
else
take
christ
for
instance
christ
responded
to
reality
by
weeping
smiling
being
sorrowful
and
moved
to
wrath
even
overcome
by
misery
he
did
not
go
to
meet
his
sufferings
with
a
smile
he
did
not
despise
death
but
prayed
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
that
this
cup
might
pass
him
by
ivan
dmitritch
laughed
and
sat
down
granted
that
a
man
s
peace
and
contentment
lie
not
outside
but
in
himself
he
said
granted
that
one
must
despise
suffering
and
not
be
surprised
at
anything
yet
on
what
ground
do
you
preach
the
theory
are
you
a
sage
a
philosopher
no
i
am
not
a
philosopher
but
everyone
ought
to
preach
it
because
it
is
reasonable
no
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
consider
yourself
competent
to
judge
of
comprehension
contempt
for
suffering
and
so
on
have
you
ever
suffered
have
you
any
idea
of
suffering
allow
me
to
ask
you
were
you
ever
thrashed
in
your
childhood
no
my
parents
had
an
aversion
for
corporal
punishment
my
father
used
to
flog
me
cruelly
my
father
was
a
harsh
sickly
government
clerk
with
a
long
nose
and
a
yellow
neck
but
let
us
talk
of
you
no
one
has
laid
a
finger
on
you
all
your
life
no
one
has
scared
you
nor
beaten
you
you
are
as
strong
as
a
bull
you
grew
up
under
your
father
s
wing
and
studied
at
his
expense
and
then
you
dropped
at
once
into
a
sinecure
for
more
than
twenty
years
you
have
lived
rent
free
with
heating
lighting
and
service
all
provided
and
had
the
right
to
work
how
you
pleased
and
as
much
as
you
pleased
even
to
do
nothing
you
were
naturally
a
flabby
lazy
man
and
so
you
have
tried
to
arrange
your
life
so
that
nothing
should
disturb
you
or
make
you
move
you
have
handed
over
your
work
to
the
assistant
and
the
rest
of
the
rabble
while
you
sit
in
peace
and
warmth
save
money
read
amuse
yourself
with
reflections
with
all
sorts
of
lofty
nonsense
and
ivan
dmitritch
looked
at
the
doctor
s
red
nose
with
boozing
in
fact
you
have
seen
nothing
of
life
you
know
absolutely
nothing
of
it
and
are
only
theoretically
acquainted
with
reality
you
despise
suffering
and
are
surprised
at
nothing
for
a
very
simple
reason
vanity
of
vanities
the
external
and
the
internal
contempt
for
life
for
suffering
and
for
death
comprehension
true
happiness
that
s
the
philosophy
that
suits
the
russian
sluggard
best
you
see
a
peasant
beating
his
wife
for
instance
why
interfere
let
him
beat
her
they
will
both
die
sooner
or
later
anyway
and
besides
he
who
beats
injures
by
his
blows
not
the
person
he
is
beating
but
himself
to
get
drunk
is
stupid
and
unseemly
but
if
you
drink
you
die
and
if
you
don
t
drink
you
die
a
peasant
woman
comes
with
toothache
well
what
of
it
pain
is
the
idea
of
pain
and
besides
there
is
no
living
in
this
world
without
illness
we
shall
all
die
and
so
go
away
woman
don
t
hinder
me
from
thinking
and
drinking
vodka
a
young
man
asks
advice
what
he
is
to
do
how
he
is
to
live
anyone
else
would
think
before
answering
but
you
have
got
the
answer
ready
strive
for
comprehension
or
for
true
happiness
and
what
is
that
fantastic
true
happiness
there
s
no
answer
of
course
we
are
kept
here
behind
barred
windows
tortured
left
to
rot
but
that
is
very
good
and
reasonable
because
there
is
no
difference
at
all
between
this
ward
and
a
warm
snug
study
a
convenient
philosophy
you
can
do
nothing
and
your
conscience
is
clear
and
you
feel
you
are
wise
no
sir
it
is
not
philosophy
it
s
not
thinking
it
s
not
breadth
of
vision
but
laziness
fakirism
drowsy
stupefaction
yes
cried
ivan
dmitritch
getting
angry
again
you
despise
suffering
but
i
ll
be
bound
if
you
pinch
your
finger
in
the
door
you
will
howl
at
the
top
of
your
voice
and
perhaps
i
shouldn
t
howl
said
andrey
yefimitch
with
a
gentle
smile
oh
i
dare
say
well
if
you
had
a
stroke
of
paralysis
or
supposing
some
fool
or
bully
took
advantage
of
his
position
and
rank
to
insult
you
in
public
and
if
you
knew
he
could
do
it
with
impunity
then
you
would
understand
what
it
means
to
put
people
off
with
comprehension
and
true
happiness
that
s
original
said
andrey
yefimitch
laughing
with
pleasure
and
rubbing
his
hands
i
am
agreeably
struck
by
your
inclination
for
drawing
generalizations
and
the
sketch
of
my
character
you
have
just
drawn
is
simply
brilliant
i
must
confess
that
talking
to
you
gives
me
great
pleasure
well
i
ve
listened
to
you
and
now
you
must
graciously
listen
to
me
xi
the
conversation
went
on
for
about
an
hour
longer
and
apparently
made
a
deep
impression
on
andrey
yefimitch
he
began
going
to
the
ward
every
day
he
went
there
in
the
mornings
and
after
dinner
and
often
the
dusk
of
evening
found
him
in
conversation
with
ivan
dmitritch
at
first
ivan
dmitritch
held
aloof
from
him
suspected
him
of
evil
designs
and
openly
expressed
his
hostility
but
afterwards
he
got
used
to
him
and
his
abrupt
manner
changed
to
one
of
condescending
irony
soon
it
was
all
over
the
hospital
that
the
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
had
taken
to
visiting
ward
no
6
no
one
neither
sergey
sergevitch
nor
nikita
nor
the
nurses
could
conceive
why
he
went
there
why
he
stayed
there
for
hours
together
what
he
was
talking
about
and
why
he
did
not
write
prescriptions
his
actions
seemed
strange
often
mihail
averyanitch
did
not
find
him
at
home
which
had
never
happened
in
the
past
and
daryushka
was
greatly
perturbed
for
the
doctor
drank
his
beer
now
at
no
definite
time
and
sometimes
was
even
late
for
dinner
one
day
it
was
at
the
end
of
june
dr
hobotov
went
to
see
andrey
yefimitch
about
something
not
finding
him
at
home
he
proceeded
to
look
for
him
in
the
yard
there
he
was
told
that
the
old
doctor
had
gone
to
see
the
mental
patients
going
into
the
lodge
and
stopping
in
the
entry
hobotov
heard
the
following
conversation
we
shall
never
agree
and
you
will
not
succeed
in
converting
me
to
your
faith
ivan
dmitritch
was
saying
irritably
you
are
utterly
ignorant
of
reality
and
you
have
never
known
suffering
but
have
only
like
a
leech
fed
beside
the
sufferings
of
others
while
i
have
been
in
continual
suffering
from
the
day
of
my
birth
till
to
day
for
that
reason
i
tell
you
frankly
i
consider
myself
superior
to
you
and
more
competent
in
every
respect
it
s
not
for
you
to
teach
me
i
have
absolutely
no
ambition
to
convert
you
to
my
faith
said
andrey
yefimitch
gently
and
with
regret
that
the
other
refused
to
understand
him
and
that
is
not
what
matters
my
friend
what
matters
is
not
that
you
have
suffered
and
i
have
not
joy
and
suffering
are
passing
let
us
leave
them
never
mind
them
what
matters
is
that
you
and
i
think
we
see
in
each
other
people
who
are
capable
of
thinking
and
reasoning
and
that
is
a
common
bond
between
us
however
different
our
views
if
you
knew
my
friend
how
sick
i
am
of
the
universal
senselessness
ineptitude
stupidity
and
with
what
delight
i
always
talk
with
you
you
are
an
intelligent
man
and
i
enjoyed
your
company
hobotov
opened
the
door
an
inch
and
glanced
into
the
ward
ivan
dmitritch
in
his
night
cap
and
the
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
bed
the
madman
was
grimacing
twitching
and
convulsively
wrapping
himself
in
his
gown
while
the
doctor
sat
motionless
with
bowed
head
and
his
face
was
red
and
look
helpless
and
sorrowful
hobotov
shrugged
his
shoulders
grinned
and
glanced
at
nikita
nikita
shrugged
his
shoulders
too
next
day
hobotov
went
to
the
lodge
accompanied
by
the
assistant
both
stood
in
the
entry
and
listened
i
fancy
our
old
man
has
gone
clean
off
his
chump
said
hobotov
as
he
came
out
of
the
lodge
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
sinners
sighed
the
decorous
sergey
sergeyitch
scrupulously
avoiding
the
puddles
that
he
might
not
muddy
his
polished
boots
i
must
own
honoured
yevgeny
fyodoritch
i
have
been
expecting
it
for
a
long
time
xii
after
this
andrey
yefimitch
began
to
notice
a
mysterious
air
in
all
around
him
the
attendants
the
nurses
and
the
patients
looked
at
him
inquisitively
when
they
met
him
and
then
whispered
together
the
superintendent
s
little
daughter
masha
whom
he
liked
to
meet
in
the
hospital
garden
for
some
reason
ran
away
from
him
now
when
he
went
up
with
a
smile
to
stroke
her
on
the
head
the
postmaster
no
longer
said
perfectly
true
as
he
listened
to
him
but
in
unaccountable
confusion
muttered
yes
yes
yes
and
looked
at
him
with
a
grieved
and
thoughtful
expression
for
some
reason
he
took
to
advising
his
friend
to
give
up
vodka
and
beer
but
as
a
man
of
delicate
feeling
he
did
not
say
this
directly
but
hinted
it
telling
him
first
about
the
commanding
officer
of
his
battalion
an
excellent
man
and
then
about
the
priest
of
the
regiment
a
capital
fellow
both
of
whom
drank
and
fell
ill
but
on
giving
up
drinking
completely
regained
their
health
on
two
or
three
occasions
andrey
yefimitch
was
visited
by
his
colleague
hobotov
who
also
advised
him
to
give
up
spirituous
liquors
and
for
no
apparent
reason
recommended
him
to
take
bromide
in
august
andrey
yefimitch
got
a
letter
from
the
mayor
of
the
town
asking
him
to
come
on
very
important
business
on
arriving
at
the
town
hall
at
the
time
fixed
andrey
yefimitch
found
there
the
military
commander
the
superintendent
of
the
district
school
a
member
of
the
town
council
hobotov
and
a
plump
fair
gentleman
who
was
introduced
to
him
as
a
doctor
this
doctor
with
a
polish
surname
difficult
to
pronounce
lived
at
a
pedigree
stud
farm
twenty
miles
away
and
was
now
on
a
visit
to
the
town
there
s
something
that
concerns
you
said
the
member
of
the
town
council
addressing
andrey
yefimitch
after
they
had
all
greeted
one
another
and
sat
down
to
the
table
here
yevgeny
fyodoritch
says
that
there
is
not
room
for
the
dispensary
in
the
main
building
and
that
it
ought
to
be
transferred
to
one
of
the
lodges
that
s
of
no
consequence
of
course
it
can
be
transferred
but
the
point
is
that
the
lodge
wants
doing
up
yes
it
would
have
to
be
done
up
said
andrey
yefimitch
after
a
moment
s
thought
if
the
corner
lodge
for
instance
were
fitted
up
as
a
dispensary
i
imagine
it
would
cost
at
least
five
hundred
roubles
an
unproductive
expenditure
everyone
was
silent
for
a
space
i
had
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
ten
years
ago
andrey
yefimitch
went
on
in
a
low
voice
that
the
hospital
in
its
present
form
is
a
luxury
for
the
town
beyond
its
means
it
was
built
in
the
forties
but
things
were
different
then
the
town
spends
too
much
on
unnecessary
buildings
and
superfluous
staff
i
believe
with
a
different
system
two
model
hospitals
might
be
maintained
for
the
same
money
well
let
us
have
a
different
system
then
the
member
of
the
town
council
said
briskly
i
have
already
had
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
that
the
medical
department
should
be
transferred
to
the
supervision
of
the
zemstvo
yes
transfer
the
money
to
the
zemstvo
and
they
will
steal
it
laughed
the
fair
haired
doctor
that
s
what
it
always
comes
to
the
member
of
the
council
assented
and
he
also
laughed
andrey
yefimitch
looked
with
apathetic
lustreless
eyes
at
the
fair
haired
doctor
and
said
one
should
be
just
again
there
was
silence
tea
was
brought
in
the
military
commander
for
some
reason
much
embarrassed
touched
andrey
yefimitch
s
hand
across
the
table
and
said
you
have
quite
forgotten
us
doctor
but
of
course
you
are
a
hermit
you
don
t
play
cards
and
don
t
like
women
you
would
be
dull
with
fellows
like
us
they
all
began
saying
how
boring
it
was
for
a
decent
person
to
live
in
such
a
town
no
theatre
no
music
and
at
the
last
dance
at
the
club
there
had
been
about
twenty
ladies
and
only
two
gentlemen
the
young
men
did
not
dance
but
spent
all
the
time
crowding
round
the
refreshment
bar
or
playing
cards
not
looking
at
anyone
and
speaking
slowly
in
a
low
voice
andrey
yefimitch
began
saying
what
a
pity
what
a
terrible
pity
it
was
that
the
townspeople
should
waste
their
vital
energy
their
hearts
and
their
minds
on
cards
and
gossip
and
should
have
neither
the
power
nor
the
inclination
to
spend
their
time
in
interesting
conversation
and
reading
and
should
refuse
to
take
advantage
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
mind
the
mind
alone
was
interesting
and
worthy
of
attention
all
the
rest
was
low
and
petty
hobotov
listened
to
his
colleague
attentively
and
suddenly
asked
andrey
yefimitch
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
having
received
an
answer
the
fair
haired
doctor
and
he
in
the
tone
of
examiners
conscious
of
their
lack
of
skill
began
asking
andrey
yefimitch
what
was
the
day
of
the
week
how
many
days
there
were
in
the
year
and
whether
it
was
true
that
there
was
a
remarkable
prophet
living
in
ward
no
6
in
response
to
the
last
question
andrey
yefimitch
turned
rather
red
and
said
yes
he
is
mentally
deranged
but
he
is
an
interesting
young
man
they
asked
him
no
other
questions
when
he
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
in
the
entry
the
military
commander
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
with
a
sigh
it
s
time
for
us
old
fellows
to
rest
as
he
came
out
of
the
hall
andrey
yefimitch
understood
that
it
had
been
a
committee
appointed
to
enquire
into
his
mental
condition
he
recalled
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
him
flushed
crimson
and
for
some
reason
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
felt
bitterly
grieved
for
medical
science
my
god
he
thought
remembering
how
these
doctors
had
just
examined
him
why
they
have
only
lately
been
hearing
lectures
on
mental
pathology
they
had
passed
an
examination
what
s
the
explanation
of
this
crass
ignorance
they
have
not
a
conception
of
mental
pathology
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
insulted
and
moved
to
anger
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
mihail
averyanitch
came
to
see
him
the
postmaster
went
up
to
him
without
waiting
to
greet
him
took
him
by
both
hands
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
my
dear
fellow
my
dear
friend
show
me
that
you
believe
in
my
genuine
affection
and
look
on
me
as
your
friend
and
preventing
andrey
yefimitch
from
speaking
he
went
on
growing
excited
i
love
you
for
your
culture
and
nobility
of
soul
listen
to
me
my
dear
fellow
the
rules
of
their
profession
compel
the
doctors
to
conceal
the
truth
from
you
but
i
blurt
out
the
plain
truth
like
a
soldier
you
are
not
well
excuse
me
my
dear
fellow
but
it
is
the
truth
everyone
about
you
has
been
noticing
it
for
a
long
time
dr
yevgeny
fyodoritch
has
just
told
me
that
it
is
essential
for
you
to
rest
and
distract
your
mind
for
the
sake
of
your
health
perfectly
true
excellent
in
a
day
or
two
i
am
taking
a
holiday
and
am
going
away
for
a
sniff
of
a
different
atmosphere
show
that
you
are
a
friend
to
me
let
us
go
together
let
us
go
for
a
jaunt
as
in
the
good
old
days
i
feel
perfectly
well
said
andrey
yefimitch
after
a
moment
s
thought
i
can
t
go
away
allow
me
to
show
you
my
friendship
in
some
other
way
to
go
off
with
no
object
without
his
books
without
his
daryushka
without
his
beer
to
break
abruptly
through
the
routine
of
life
established
for
twenty
years
the
idea
for
the
first
minute
struck
him
as
wild
and
fantastic
but
he
remembered
the
conversation
at
the
zemstvo
committee
and
the
depressing
feelings
with
which
he
had
returned
home
and
the
thought
of
a
brief
absence
from
the
town
in
which
stupid
people
looked
on
him
as
a
madman
was
pleasant
to
him
and
where
precisely
do
you
intend
to
go
he
asked
to
moscow
to
petersburg
to
warsaw
i
spent
the
five
happiest
years
of
my
life
in
warsaw
what
a
marvellous
town
let
us
go
my
dear
fellow
xiii
a
week
later
it
was
suggested
to
andrey
yefimitch
that
he
should
have
a
rest
that
is
send
in
his
resignation
a
suggestion
he
received
with
indifference
and
a
week
later
still
mihail
averyanitch
and
he
were
sitting
in
a
posting
carriage
driving
to
the
nearest
railway
station
the
days
were
cool
and
bright
with
a
blue
sky
and
a
transparent
distance
they
were
two
days
driving
the
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
railway
station
and
stayed
two
nights
on
the
way
when
at
the
posting
station
the
glasses
given
them
for
their
tea
had
not
been
properly
washed
or
the
drivers
were
slow
in
harnessing
the
horses
mihail
averyanitch
would
turn
crimson
and
quivering
all
over
would
shout
hold
your
tongue
don
t
argue
and
in
the
carriage
he
talked
without
ceasing
for
a
moment
describing
his
campaigns
in
the
caucasus
and
in
poland
what
adventures
he
had
had
what
meetings
he
talked
loudly
and
opened
his
eyes
so
wide
with
wonder
that
he
might
well
be
thought
to
be
lying
moreover
as
he
talked
he
breathed
in
andrey
yefimitch
s
face
and
laughed
into
his
ear
this
bothered
the
doctor
and
prevented
him
from
thinking
or
concentrating
his
mind
in
the
train
they
travelled
from
motives
of
economy
third
class
in
a
non
smoking
compartment
half
the
passengers
were
decent
people
mihail
averyanitch
soon
made
friends
with
everyone
and
moving
from
one
seat
to
another
kept
saying
loudly
that
they
ought
not
to
travel
by
these
appalling
lines
it
was
a
regular
swindle
a
very
different
thing
riding
on
a
good
horse
one
could
do
over
seventy
miles
a
day
and
feel
fresh
and
well
after
it
and
our
bad
harvests
were
due
to
the
draining
of
the
pinsk
marshes
altogether
the
way
things
were
done
was
dreadful
he
got
excited
talked
loudly
and
would
not
let
others
speak
this
endless
chatter
to
the
accompaniment
of
loud
laughter
and
expressive
gestures
wearied
andrey
yefimitch
which
of
us
is
the
madman
he
thought
with
vexation
i
who
try
not
to
disturb
my
fellow
passengers
in
any
way
or
this
egoist
who
thinks
that
he
is
cleverer
and
more
interesting
than
anyone
here
and
so
will
leave
no
one
in
peace
in
moscow
mihail
averyanitch
put
on
a
military
coat
without
epaulettes
and
trousers
with
red
braid
on
them
he
wore
a
military
cap
and
overcoat
in
the
street
and
soldiers
saluted
him
it
seemed
to
andrey
yefimitch
now
that
his
companion
was
a
man
who
had
flung
away
all
that
was
good
and
kept
only
what
was
bad
of
all
the
characteristics
of
a
country
gentleman
that
he
had
once
possessed
he
liked
to
be
waited
on
even
when
it
was
quite
unnecessary
the
matches
would
be
lying
before
him
on
the
table
and
he
would
see
them
and
shout
to
the
waiter
to
give
him
the
matches
he
did
not
hesitate
to
appear
before
a
maidservant
in
nothing
but
his
underclothes
he
used
the
familiar
mode
of
address
to
all
footmen
indiscriminately
even
old
men
and
when
he
was
angry
called
them
fools
and
blockheads
this
andrey
yefimitch
thought
was
like
a
gentleman
but
disgusting
first
of
all
mihail
averyanitch
led
his
friend
to
the
iversky
madonna
he
prayed
fervently
shedding
tears
and
bowing
down
to
the
earth
and
when
he
had
finished
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
even
though
one
does
not
believe
it
makes
one
somehow
easier
when
one
prays
a
little
kiss
the
ikon
my
dear
fellow
andrey
yefimitch
was
embarrassed
and
he
kissed
the
image
while
mihail
averyanitch
pursed
up
his
lips
and
prayed
in
a
whisper
and
again
tears
came
into
his
eyes
then
they
went
to
the
kremlin
and
looked
there
at
the
tsar
cannon
and
the
tsar
bell
and
even
touched
them
with
their
fingers
admired
the
view
over
the
river
visited
st
saviour
s
and
the
rumyantsev
museum
they
dined
at
tyestov
s
mihail
averyanitch
looked
a
long
time
at
the
menu
stroking
his
whiskers
and
said
in
the
tone
of
a
gourmand
accustomed
to
dine
in
restaurants
we
shall
see
what
you
give
us
to
eat
to
day
angel
xiv
the
doctor
walked
about
looked
at
things
ate
and
drank
but
he
had
all
the
while
one
feeling
annoyance
with
mihail
averyanitch
he
longed
to
have
a
rest
from
his
friend
to
get
away
from
him
to
hide
himself
while
the
friend
thought
it
was
his
duty
not
to
let
the
doctor
move
a
step
away
from
him
and
to
provide
him
with
as
many
distractions
as
possible
when
there
was
nothing
to
look
at
he
entertained
him
with
conversation
for
two
days
andrey
yefimitch
endured
it
but
on
the
third
he
announced
to
his
friend
that
he
was
ill
and
wanted
to
stay
at
home
for
the
whole
day
his
friend
replied
that
in
that
case
he
would
stay
too
that
really
he
needed
rest
for
he
was
run
off
his
legs
already
andrey
yefimitch
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
back
and
clenching
his
teeth
listened
to
his
friend
who
assured
him
with
heat
that
sooner
or
later
france
would
certainly
thrash
germany
that
there
were
a
great
many
scoundrels
in
moscow
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
judge
of
a
horse
s
quality
by
its
outward
appearance
the
doctor
began
to
have
a
buzzing
in
his
ears
and
palpitations
of
the
heart
but
out
of
delicacy
could
not
bring
himself
to
beg
his
friend
to
go
away
or
hold
his
tongue
fortunately
mihail
averyanitch
grew
weary
of
sitting
in
the
hotel
room
and
after
dinner
he
went
out
for
a
walk
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
andrey
yefimitch
abandoned
himself
to
a
feeling
of
relief
how
pleasant
to
lie
motionless
on
the
sofa
and
to
know
that
one
is
alone
in
the
room
real
happiness
is
impossible
without
solitude
the
fallen
angel
betrayed
god
probably
because
he
longed
for
solitude
of
which
the
angels
know
nothing
andrey
yefimitch
wanted
to
think
about
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
during
the
last
few
days
but
he
could
not
get
mihail
averyanitch
out
of
his
head
why
he
has
taken
a
holiday
and
come
with
me
out
of
friendship
out
of
generosity
thought
the
doctor
with
vexation
nothing
could
be
worse
than
this
friendly
supervision
i
suppose
he
is
good
natured
and
generous
and
a
lively
fellow
but
he
is
a
bore
an
insufferable
bore
in
the
same
way
there
are
people
who
never
say
anything
but
what
is
clever
and
good
yet
one
feels
that
they
are
dull
witted
people
for
the
following
days
andrey
yefimitch
declared
himself
ill
and
would
not
leave
the
hotel
room
he
lay
with
his
face
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
suffered
agonies
of
weariness
when
his
friend
entertained
him
with
conversation
or
rested
when
his
friend
was
absent
he
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
come
and
with
his
friend
who
grew
every
day
more
talkative
and
more
free
and
easy
he
could
not
succeed
in
attuning
his
thoughts
to
a
serious
and
lofty
level
this
is
what
i
get
from
the
real
life
ivan
dmitritch
talked
about
he
thought
angry
at
his
own
pettiness
it
s
of
no
consequence
though
i
shall
go
home
and
everything
will
go
on
as
before
it
was
the
same
thing
in
petersburg
too
for
whole
days
together
he
did
not
leave
the
hotel
room
but
lay
on
the
sofa
and
only
got
up
to
drink
beer
mihail
averyanitch
was
all
haste
to
get
to
warsaw
my
dear
man
what
should
i
go
there
for
said
andrey
yefimitch
in
an
imploring
voice
you
go
alone
and
let
me
get
home
i
entreat
you
on
no
account
protested
mihail
averyanitch
it
s
a
marvellous
town
andrey
yefimitch
had
not
the
strength
of
will
to
insist
on
his
own
way
and
much
against
his
inclination
went
to
warsaw
there
he
did
not
leave
the
hotel
room
but
lay
on
the
sofa
furious
with
himself
with
his
friend
and
with
the
waiters
who
obstinately
refused
to
understand
russian
while
mihail
averyanitch
healthy
hearty
and
full
of
spirits
as
usual
went
about
the
town
from
morning
to
night
looking
for
his
old
acquaintances
several
times
he
did
not
return
home
at
night
after
one
night
spent
in
some
unknown
haunt
he
returned
home
early
in
the
morning
in
a
violently
excited
condition
with
a
red
face
and
tousled
hair
for
a
long
time
he
walked
up
and
down
the
rooms
muttering
something
to
himself
then
stopped
and
said
honour
before
everything
after
walking
up
and
down
a
little
longer
he
clutched
his
head
in
both
hands
and
pronounced
in
a
tragic
voice
yes
honour
before
everything
accursed
be
the
moment
when
the
idea
first
entered
my
head
to
visit
this
babylon
my
dear
friend
he
added
addressing
the
doctor
you
may
despise
me
i
have
played
and
lost
lend
me
five
hundred
roubles
andrey
yefimitch
counted
out
five
hundred
roubles
and
gave
them
to
his
friend
without
a
word
the
latter
still
crimson
with
shame
and
anger
incoherently
articulated
some
useless
vow
put
on
his
cap
and
went
out
returning
two
hours
later
he
flopped
into
an
easy
chair
heaved
a
loud
sigh
and
said
my
honour
is
saved
let
us
go
my
friend
i
do
not
care
to
remain
another
hour
in
this
accursed
town
scoundrels
austrian
spies
by
the
time
the
friends
were
back
in
their
own
town
it
was
november
and
deep
snow
was
lying
in
the
streets
dr
hobotov
had
andrey
yefimitch
s
post
he
was
still
living
in
his
old
lodgings
waiting
for
andrey
yefimitch
to
arrive
and
clear
out
of
the
hospital
apartments
the
plain
woman
whom
he
called
his
cook
was
already
established
in
one
of
the
lodges
fresh
scandals
about
the
hospital
were
going
the
round
of
the
town
it
was
said
that
the
plain
woman
had
quarrelled
with
the
superintendent
and
that
the
latter
had
crawled
on
his
knees
before
her
begging
forgiveness
on
the
very
first
day
he
arrived
andrey
yefimitch
had
to
look
out
for
lodgings
my
friend
the
postmaster
said
to
him
timidly
excuse
an
indiscreet
question
what
means
have
you
at
your
disposal
andrey
yefimitch
without
a
word
counted
out
his
money
and
said
eighty
six
roubles
i
don
t
mean
that
mihail
averyanitch
brought
out
in
confusion
misunderstanding
him
i
mean
what
have
you
to
live
on
i
tell
you
eighty
six
roubles
i
have
nothing
else
mihail
averyanitch
looked
upon
the
doctor
as
an
honourable
man
yet
he
suspected
that
he
had
accumulated
a
fortune
of
at
least
twenty
thousand
now
learning
that
andrey
yefimitch
was
a
beggar
that
he
had
nothing
to
live
on
he
was
for
some
reason
suddenly
moved
to
tears
and
embraced
his
friend
xv
andrey
yefimitch
now
lodged
in
a
little
house
with
three
windows
there
were
only
three
rooms
besides
the
kitchen
in
the
little
house
the
doctor
lived
in
two
of
them
which
looked
into
the
street
while
daryushka
and
the
landlady
with
her
three
children
lived
in
the
third
room
and
the
kitchen
sometimes
the
landlady
s
lover
a
drunken
peasant
who
was
rowdy
and
reduced
the
children
and
daryushka
to
terror
would
come
for
the
night
when
he
arrived
and
established
himself
in
the
kitchen
and
demanded
vodka
they
all
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
the
doctor
would
be
moved
by
pity
to
take
the
crying
children
into
his
room
and
let
them
lie
on
his
floor
and
this
gave
him
great
satisfaction
he
got
up
as
before
at
eight
o
clock
and
after
his
morning
tea
sat
down
to
read
his
old
books
and
magazines
he
had
no
money
for
new
ones
either
because
the
books
were
old
or
perhaps
because
of
the
change
in
his
surroundings
reading
exhausted
him
and
did
not
grip
his
attention
as
before
that
he
might
not
spend
his
time
in
idleness
he
made
a
detailed
catalogue
of
his
books
and
gummed
little
labels
on
their
backs
and
this
mechanical
tedious
work
seemed
to
him
more
interesting
than
reading
the
monotonous
tedious
work
lulled
his
thoughts
to
sleep
in
some
unaccountable
way
and
the
time
passed
quickly
while
he
thought
of
nothing
even
sitting
in
the
kitchen
peeling
potatoes
with
daryushka
or
picking
over
the
buckwheat
grain
seemed
to
him
interesting
on
saturdays
and
sundays
he
went
to
church
standing
near
the
wall
and
half
closing
his
eyes
he
listened
to
the
singing
and
thought
of
his
father
of
his
mother
of
the
university
of
the
religions
of
the
world
he
felt
calm
and
melancholy
and
as
he
went
out
of
the
church
afterwards
he
regretted
that
the
service
was
so
soon
over
he
went
twice
to
the
hospital
to
talk
to
ivan
dmitritch
but
on
both
occasions
ivan
dmitritch
was
unusually
excited
and
ill
humoured
he
bade
the
doctor
leave
him
in
peace
as
he
had
long
been
sick
of
empty
chatter
and
declared
to
make
up
for
all
his
sufferings
he
asked
from
the
damned
scoundrels
only
one
favour
solitary
confinement
surely
they
would
not
refuse
him
even
that
on
both
occasions
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
taking
leave
of
him
and
wishing
him
good
night
he
answered
rudely
and
said
go
to
hell
and
andrey
yefimitch
did
not
know
now
whether
to
go
to
him
for
the
third
time
or
not
he
longed
to
go
in
old
days
andrey
yefimitch
used
to
walk
about
his
rooms
and
think
in
the
interval
after
dinner
but
now
from
dinner
time
till
evening
tea
he
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
back
and
gave
himself
up
to
trivial
thoughts
which
he
could
not
struggle
against
he
was
mortified
that
after
more
than
twenty
years
of
service
he
had
been
given
neither
a
pension
nor
any
assistance
it
is
true
that
he
had
not
done
his
work
honestly
but
then
all
who
are
in
the
service
get
a
pension
without
distinction
whether
they
are
honest
or
not
contemporary
justice
lies
precisely
in
the
bestowal
of
grades
orders
and
pensions
not
for
moral
qualities
or
capacities
but
for
service
whatever
it
may
have
been
like
why
was
he
alone
to
be
an
exception
he
had
no
money
at
all
he
was
ashamed
to
pass
by
the
shop
and
look
at
the
woman
who
owned
it
he
owed
thirty
two
roubles
for
beer
already
there
was
money
owing
to
the
landlady
also
daryushka
sold
old
clothes
and
books
on
the
sly
and
told
lies
to
the
landlady
saying
that
the
doctor
was
just
going
to
receive
a
large
sum
of
money
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
having
wasted
on
travelling
the
thousand
roubles
he
had
saved
up
how
useful
that
thousand
roubles
would
have
been
now
he
was
vexed
that
people
would
not
leave
him
in
peace
hobotov
thought
it
his
duty
to
look
in
on
his
sick
colleague
from
time
to
time
everything
about
him
was
revolting
to
andrey
yefimitch
his
well
fed
face
and
vulgar
condescending
tone
and
his
use
of
the
word
colleague
and
his
high
top
boots
the
most
revolting
thing
was
that
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
treat
andrey
yefimitch
and
thought
that
he
really
was
treating
him
on
every
visit
he
brought
a
bottle
of
bromide
and
rhubarb
pills
mihail
averyanitch
too
thought
it
his
duty
to
visit
his
friend
and
entertain
him
every
time
he
went
in
to
andrey
yefimitch
with
an
affectation
of
ease
laughed
constrainedly
and
began
assuring
him
that
he
was
looking
very
well
to
day
and
that
thank
god
he
was
on
the
highroad
to
recovery
and
from
this
it
might
be
concluded
that
he
looked
on
his
friend
s
condition
as
hopeless
he
had
not
yet
repaid
his
warsaw
debt
and
was
overwhelmed
by
shame
he
was
constrained
and
so
tried
to
laugh
louder
and
talk
more
amusingly
his
anecdotes
and
descriptions
seemed
endless
now
and
were
an
agony
both
to
andrey
yefimitch
and
himself
in
his
presence
andrey
yefimitch
usually
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
listened
with
his
teeth
clenched
his
soul
was
oppressed
with
rankling
disgust
and
after
every
visit
from
his
friend
he
felt
as
though
this
disgust
had
risen
higher
and
was
mounting
into
his
throat
to
stifle
petty
thoughts
he
made
haste
to
reflect
that
he
himself
and
hobotov
and
mihail
averyanitch
would
all
sooner
or
later
perish
without
leaving
any
trace
on
the
world
if
one
imagined
some
spirit
flying
by
the
earthly
globe
in
space
in
a
million
years
he
would
see
nothing
but
clay
and
bare
rocks
everything
culture
and
the
moral
law
would
pass
away
and
not
even
a
burdock
would
grow
out
of
them
of
what
consequence
was
shame
in
the
presence
of
a
shopkeeper
of
what
consequence
was
the
insignificant
hobotov
or
the
wearisome
friendship
of
mihail
averyanitch
it
was
all
trivial
and
nonsensical
but
such
reflections
did
not
help
him
now
scarcely
had
he
imagined
the
earthly
globe
in
a
million
years
when
hobotov
in
his
high
top
boots
or
mihail
averyanitch
with
his
forced
laugh
would
appear
from
behind
a
bare
rock
and
he
even
heard
the
shamefaced
whisper
the
warsaw
debt
i
will
repay
it
in
a
day
or
two
my
dear
fellow
without
fail
xvi
one
day
mihail
averyanitch
came
after
dinner
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
lying
on
the
sofa
it
so
happened
that
hobotov
arrived
at
the
same
time
with
his
bromide
andrey
yefimitch
got
up
heavily
and
sat
down
leaning
both
arms
on
the
sofa
you
have
a
much
better
colour
to
day
than
you
had
yesterday
my
dear
man
began
mihail
averyanitch
yes
you
look
jolly
upon
my
soul
you
do
it
s
high
time
you
were
well
dear
colleague
said
hobotov
yawning
i
ll
be
bound
you
are
sick
of
this
bobbery
and
we
shall
recover
said
mihail
averyanitch
cheerfully
we
shall
live
another
hundred
years
to
be
sure
not
a
hundred
years
but
another
twenty
hobotov
said
reassuringly
it
s
all
right
all
right
colleague
don
t
lose
heart
don
t
go
piling
it
on
we
ll
show
what
we
can
do
laughed
mihail
averyanitch
and
he
slapped
his
friend
on
the
knee
we
ll
show
them
yet
next
summer
please
god
we
shall
be
off
to
the
caucasus
and
we
will
ride
all
over
it
on
horseback
trot
trot
trot
and
when
we
are
back
from
the
caucasus
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
we
will
all
dance
at
the
wedding
mihail
averyanitch
gave
a
sly
wink
we
ll
marry
you
my
dear
boy
we
ll
marry
you
andrey
yefimitch
felt
suddenly
that
the
rising
disgust
had
mounted
to
his
throat
his
heart
began
beating
violently
that
s
vulgar
he
said
getting
up
quickly
and
walking
away
to
the
window
don
t
you
understand
that
you
are
talking
vulgar
nonsense
he
meant
to
go
on
softly
and
politely
but
against
his
will
he
suddenly
clenched
his
fists
and
raised
them
above
his
head
leave
me
alone
he
shouted
in
a
voice
unlike
his
own
blushing
crimson
and
shaking
all
over
go
away
both
of
you
mihail
averyanitch
and
hobotov
got
up
and
stared
at
him
first
with
amazement
and
then
with
alarm
go
away
both
andrey
yefimitch
went
on
shouting
stupid
people
foolish
people
i
don
t
want
either
your
friendship
or
your
medicines
stupid
man
vulgar
nasty
hobotov
and
mihail
averyanitch
looking
at
each
other
in
bewilderment
staggered
to
the
door
and
went
out
andrey
yefimitch
snatched
up
the
bottle
of
bromide
and
flung
it
after
them
the
bottle
broke
with
a
crash
on
the
door
frame
go
to
the
devil
he
shouted
in
a
tearful
voice
running
out
into
the
passage
to
the
devil
when
his
guests
were
gone
andrey
yefimitch
lay
down
on
the
sofa
trembling
as
though
in
a
fever
and
went
on
for
a
long
while
repeating
stupid
people
foolish
people
when
he
was
calmer
what
occurred
to
him
first
of
all
was
the
thought
that
poor
mihail
averyanitch
must
be
feeling
fearfully
ashamed
and
depressed
now
and
that
it
was
all
dreadful
nothing
like
this
had
ever
happened
to
him
before
where
was
his
intelligence
and
his
tact
where
was
his
comprehension
of
things
and
his
philosophical
indifference
the
doctor
could
not
sleep
all
night
for
shame
and
vexation
with
himself
and
at
ten
o
clock
next
morning
he
went
to
the
post
office
and
apologized
to
the
postmaster
we
won
t
think
again
of
what
has
happened
mihail
averyanitch
greatly
touched
said
with
a
sigh
warmly
pressing
his
hand
let
bygones
be
bygones
lyubavkin
he
suddenly
shouted
so
loud
that
all
the
postmen
and
other
persons
present
started
hand
a
chair
and
you
wait
he
shouted
to
a
peasant
woman
who
was
stretching
out
a
registered
letter
to
him
through
the
grating
don
t
you
see
that
i
am
busy
we
will
not
remember
the
past
he
went
on
affectionately
addressing
andrey
yefimitch
sit
down
i
beg
you
my
dear
fellow
for
a
minute
he
stroked
his
knees
in
silence
and
then
said
i
have
never
had
a
thought
of
taking
offence
illness
is
no
joke
i
understand
your
attack
frightened
the
doctor
and
me
yesterday
and
we
had
a
long
talk
about
you
afterwards
my
dear
friend
why
won
t
you
treat
your
illness
seriously
you
can
t
go
on
like
this
excuse
me
speaking
openly
as
a
friend
whispered
mihail
averyanitch
you
live
in
the
most
unfavourable
surroundings
in
a
crowd
in
uncleanliness
no
one
to
look
after
you
no
money
for
proper
treatment
my
dear
friend
the
doctor
and
i
implore
you
with
all
our
hearts
listen
to
our
advice
go
into
the
hospital
there
you
will
have
wholesome
food
and
attendance
and
treatment
though
between
ourselves
yevgeny
fyodoritch
is
mauvais
ton
yet
he
does
understand
his
work
you
can
fully
rely
upon
him
he
has
promised
me
he
will
look
after
you
andrey
yefimitch
was
touched
by
the
postmaster
s
genuine
sympathy
and
the
tears
which
suddenly
glittered
on
his
cheeks
my
honoured
friend
don
t
believe
it
he
whispered
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
don
t
believe
them
it
s
all
a
sham
my
illness
is
only
that
in
twenty
years
i
have
only
found
one
intelligent
man
in
the
whole
town
and
he
is
mad
i
am
not
ill
at
all
it
s
simply
that
i
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
which
there
is
no
getting
out
of
i
don
t
care
i
am
ready
for
anything
go
into
the
hospital
my
dear
fellow
i
don
t
care
if
it
were
into
the
pit
give
me
your
word
my
dear
man
that
you
will
obey
yevgeny
fyodoritch
in
everything
certainly
i
will
give
you
my
word
but
i
repeat
my
honoured
friend
i
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
now
everything
even
the
genuine
sympathy
of
my
friends
leads
to
the
same
thing
to
my
ruin
i
am
going
to
my
ruin
and
i
have
the
manliness
to
recognize
it
my
dear
fellow
you
will
recover
what
s
the
use
of
saying
that
said
andrey
yefimitch
with
irritation
there
are
few
men
who
at
the
end
of
their
lives
do
not
experience
what
i
am
experiencing
now
when
you
are
told
that
you
have
something
such
as
diseased
kidneys
or
enlarged
heart
and
you
begin
being
treated
for
it
or
are
told
you
are
mad
or
a
criminal
that
is
in
fact
when
people
suddenly
turn
their
attention
to
you
you
may
be
sure
you
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
from
which
you
will
not
escape
you
will
try
to
escape
and
make
things
worse
you
had
better
give
in
for
no
human
efforts
can
save
you
so
it
seems
to
me
meanwhile
the
public
was
crowding
at
the
grating
that
he
might
not
be
in
their
way
andrey
yefimitch
got
up
and
began
to
take
leave
mihail
averyanitch
made
him
promise
on
his
honour
once
more
and
escorted
him
to
the
outer
door
towards
evening
on
the
same
day
hobotov
in
his
sheepskin
and
his
high
top
boots
suddenly
made
his
appearance
and
said
to
andrey
yefimitch
in
a
tone
as
though
nothing
had
happened
the
day
before
i
have
come
on
business
colleague
i
have
come
to
ask
you
whether
you
would
not
join
me
in
a
consultation
eh
thinking
that
hobotov
wanted
to
distract
his
mind
with
an
outing
or
perhaps
really
to
enable
him
to
earn
something
andrey
yefimitch
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
went
out
with
him
into
the
street
he
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
smooth
over
his
fault
of
the
previous
day
and
to
be
reconciled
and
in
his
heart
thanked
hobotov
who
did
not
even
allude
to
yesterday
s
scene
and
was
evidently
sparing
him
one
would
never
have
expected
such
delicacy
from
this
uncultured
man
where
is
your
invalid
asked
andrey
yefimitch
in
the
hospital
i
have
long
wanted
to
show
him
to
you
a
very
interesting
case
they
went
into
the
hospital
yard
and
going
round
the
main
building
turned
towards
the
lodge
where
the
mental
cases
were
kept
and
all
this
for
some
reason
in
silence
when
they
went
into
the
lodge
nikita
as
usual
jumped
up
and
stood
at
attention
one
of
the
patients
here
has
a
lung
complication
hobotov
said
in
an
undertone
going
into
the
yard
with
andrey
yefimitch
you
wait
here
i
ll
be
back
directly
i
am
going
for
a
stethoscope
and
he
went
away
xvii
it
was
getting
dusk
ivan
dmitritch
was
lying
on
his
bed
with
his
face
thrust
unto
his
pillow
the
paralytic
was
sitting
motionless
crying
quietly
and
moving
his
lips
the
fat
peasant
and
the
former
sorter
were
asleep
it
was
quiet
andrey
yefimitch
sat
down
on
ivan
dmitritch
s
bed
and
waited
but
half
an
hour
passed
and
instead
of
hobotov
nikita
came
into
the
ward
with
a
dressing
gown
some
underlinen
and
a
pair
of
slippers
in
a
heap
on
his
arm
please
change
your
things
your
honour
he
said
softly
here
is
your
bed
come
this
way
he
added
pointing
to
an
empty
bedstead
which
had
obviously
recently
been
brought
into
the
ward
it
s
all
right
please
god
you
will
recover
andrey
yefimitch
understood
it
all
without
saying
a
word
he
crossed
to
the
bed
to
which
nikita
pointed
and
sat
down
seeing
that
nikita
was
standing
waiting
he
undressed
entirely
and
he
felt
ashamed
then
he
put
on
the
hospital
clothes
the
drawers
were
very
short
the
shirt
was
long
and
the
dressing
gown
smelt
of
smoked
fish
please
god
you
will
recover
repeated
nikita
and
he
gathered
up
andrey
yefimitch
s
clothes
into
his
arms
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
no
matter
thought
andrey
yefimitch
wrapping
himself
in
his
dressing
gown
in
a
shamefaced
way
and
feeling
that
he
looked
like
a
convict
in
his
new
costume
it
s
no
matter
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
s
a
dress
coat
or
a
uniform
or
this
dressing
gown
but
how
about
his
watch
and
the
notebook
that
was
in
the
side
pocket
and
his
cigarettes
where
had
nikita
taken
his
clothes
now
perhaps
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
would
not
put
on
trousers
a
waistcoat
and
high
boots
it
was
all
somehow
strange
and
even
incomprehensible
at
first
andrey
yefimitch
was
even
now
convinced
that
there
was
no
difference
between
his
landlady
s
house
and
ward
no
6
that
everything
in
this
world
was
nonsense
and
vanity
of
vanities
and
yet
his
hands
were
trembling
his
feet
were
cold
and
he
was
filled
with
dread
at
the
thought
that
soon
ivan
dmitritch
would
get
up
and
see
that
he
was
in
a
dressing
gown
he
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
and
sat
down
again
here
he
had
been
sitting
already
half
an
hour
an
hour
and
he
was
miserably
sick
of
it
was
it
really
possible
to
live
here
a
day
a
week
and
even
years
like
these
people
why
he
had
been
sitting
here
had
walked
about
and
sat
down
again
he
could
get
up
and
look
out
of
window
and
walk
from
corner
to
corner
again
and
then
what
sit
so
all
the
time
like
a
post
and
think
no
that
was
scarcely
possible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
down
but
at
once
got
up
wiped
the
cold
sweat
from
his
brow
with
his
sleeve
and
felt
that
his
whole
face
smelt
of
smoked
fish
he
walked
about
again
it
s
some
misunderstanding
he
said
turning
out
the
palms
of
his
hands
in
perplexity
it
must
be
cleared
up
there
is
a
misunderstanding
meanwhile
ivan
dmitritch
woke
up
he
sat
up
and
propped
his
cheeks
on
his
fists
he
spat
then
he
glanced
lazily
at
the
doctor
and
apparently
for
the
first
minute
did
not
understand
but
soon
his
sleepy
face
grew
malicious
and
mocking
aha
so
they
have
put
you
in
here
too
old
fellow
he
said
in
a
voice
husky
from
sleepiness
screwing
up
one
eye
very
glad
to
see
you
you
sucked
the
blood
of
others
and
now
they
will
suck
yours
excellent
it
s
a
misunderstanding
andrey
yefimitch
brought
out
frightened
by
ivan
dmitritch
s
words
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
repeated
it
s
some
misunderstanding
ivan
dmitritch
spat
again
and
lay
down
cursed
life
he
grumbled
and
what
s
bitter
and
insulting
this
life
will
not
end
in
compensation
for
our
sufferings
it
will
not
end
with
apotheosis
as
it
would
in
an
opera
but
with
death
peasants
will
come
and
drag
one
s
dead
body
by
the
arms
and
the
legs
to
the
cellar
ugh
well
it
does
not
matter
we
shall
have
our
good
time
in
the
other
world
i
shall
come
here
as
a
ghost
from
the
other
world
and
frighten
these
reptiles
i
ll
turn
their
hair
grey
moiseika
returned
and
seeing
the
doctor
held
out
his
hand
give
me
one
little
kopeck
he
said
xviii
andrey
yefimitch
walked
away
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
open
country
it
was
getting
dark
and
on
the
horizon
to
the
right
a
cold
crimson
moon
was
mounting
upwards
not
far
from
the
hospital
fence
not
much
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
stood
a
tall
white
house
shut
in
by
a
stone
wall
this
was
the
prison
so
this
is
real
life
thought
andrey
yefimitch
and
he
felt
frightened
the
moon
and
the
prison
and
the
nails
on
the
fence
and
the
far
away
flames
at
the
bone
charring
factory
were
all
terrible
behind
him
there
was
the
sound
of
a
sigh
andrey
yefimitch
looked
round
and
saw
a
man
with
glittering
stars
and
orders
on
his
breast
who
was
smiling
and
slyly
winking
and
this
too
seemed
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
assured
himself
that
there
was
nothing
special
about
the
moon
or
the
prison
that
even
sane
persons
wear
orders
and
that
everything
in
time
will
decay
and
turn
to
earth
but
he
was
suddenly
overcome
with
desire
he
clutched
at
the
grating
with
both
hands
and
shook
it
with
all
his
might
the
strong
grating
did
not
yield
then
that
it
might
not
be
so
dreadful
he
went
to
ivan
dmitritch
s
bed
and
sat
down
i
have
lost
heart
my
dear
fellow
he
muttered
trembling
and
wiping
away
the
cold
sweat
i
have
lost
heart
you
should
be
philosophical
said
ivan
dmitritch
ironically
my
god
my
god
yes
yes
you
were
pleased
to
say
once
that
there
was
no
philosophy
in
russia
but
that
all
people
even
the
paltriest
talk
philosophy
but
you
know
the
philosophizing
of
the
paltriest
does
not
harm
anyone
said
andrey
yefimitch
in
a
tone
as
if
he
wanted
to
cry
and
complain
why
then
that
malignant
laugh
my
friend
and
how
can
these
paltry
creatures
help
philosophizing
if
they
are
not
satisfied
for
an
intelligent
educated
man
made
in
god
s
image
proud
and
loving
freedom
to
have
no
alternative
but
to
be
a
doctor
in
a
filthy
stupid
wretched
little
town
and
to
spend
his
whole
life
among
bottles
leeches
mustard
plasters
quackery
narrowness
vulgarity
oh
my
god
you
are
talking
nonsense
if
you
don
t
like
being
a
doctor
you
should
have
gone
in
for
being
a
statesman
i
could
not
i
could
not
do
anything
we
are
weak
my
dear
friend
i
used
to
be
indifferent
i
reasoned
boldly
and
soundly
but
at
the
first
coarse
touch
of
life
upon
me
i
have
lost
heart
prostration
we
are
weak
we
are
poor
creatures
and
you
too
my
dear
friend
you
are
intelligent
generous
you
drew
in
good
impulses
with
your
mother
s
milk
but
you
had
hardly
entered
upon
life
when
you
were
exhausted
and
fell
ill
weak
weak
andrey
yefimitch
was
all
the
while
at
the
approach
of
evening
tormented
by
another
persistent
sensation
besides
terror
and
the
feeling
of
resentment
at
last
he
realized
that
he
was
longing
for
a
smoke
and
for
beer
i
am
going
out
my
friend
he
said
i
will
tell
them
to
bring
a
light
i
can
t
put
up
with
this
i
am
not
equal
to
it
andrey
yefimitch
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
but
at
once
nikita
jumped
up
and
barred
his
way
where
are
you
going
you
can
t
you
can
t
he
said
it
s
bedtime
but
i
m
only
going
out
for
a
minute
to
walk
about
the
yard
said
andrey
yefimitch
you
can
t
you
can
t
it
s
forbidden
you
know
that
yourself
but
what
difference
will
it
make
to
anyone
if
i
do
go
out
asked
andrey
yefimitch
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
don
t
understand
nikita
i
must
go
out
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
i
must
don
t
be
disorderly
it
s
not
right
nikita
said
peremptorily
this
is
beyond
everything
ivan
dmitritch
cried
suddenly
and
he
jumped
up
what
right
has
he
not
to
let
you
out
how
dare
they
keep
us
here
i
believe
it
is
clearly
laid
down
in
the
law
that
no
one
can
be
deprived
of
freedom
without
trial
it
s
an
outrage
it
s
tyranny
of
course
it
s
tyranny
said
andrey
yefimitch
encouraged
by
ivan
dmitritch
s
outburst
i
must
go
out
i
want
to
he
has
no
right
open
i
tell
you
do
you
hear
you
dull
witted
brute
cried
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
banged
on
the
door
with
his
fist
open
the
door
or
i
will
break
it
open
torturer
open
the
door
cried
andrey
yefimitch
trembling
all
over
i
insist
talk
away
nikita
answered
through
the
door
talk
away
anyhow
go
and
call
yevgeny
fyodoritch
say
that
i
beg
him
to
come
for
a
minute
his
honour
will
come
of
himself
to
morrow
they
will
never
let
us
out
ivan
dmitritch
was
going
on
meanwhile
they
will
leave
us
to
rot
here
oh
lord
can
there
really
be
no
hell
in
the
next
world
and
will
these
wretches
be
forgiven
where
is
justice
open
the
door
you
wretch
i
am
choking
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
flung
himself
upon
the
door
i
ll
dash
out
my
brains
murderers
nikita
opened
the
door
quickly
and
roughly
with
both
his
hands
and
his
knee
shoved
andrey
yefimitch
back
then
swung
his
arm
and
punched
him
in
the
face
with
his
fist
it
seemed
to
andrey
yefimitch
as
though
a
huge
salt
wave
enveloped
him
from
his
head
downwards
and
dragged
him
to
the
bed
there
really
was
a
salt
taste
in
his
mouth
most
likely
the
blood
was
running
from
his
teeth
he
waved
his
arms
as
though
he
were
trying
to
swim
out
and
clutched
at
a
bedstead
and
at
the
same
moment
felt
nikita
hit
him
twice
on
the
back
ivan
dmitritch
gave
a
loud
scream
he
must
have
been
beaten
too
then
all
was
still
the
faint
moonlight
came
through
the
grating
and
a
shadow
like
a
net
lay
on
the
floor
it
was
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
and
held
his
breath
he
was
expecting
with
horror
to
be
struck
again
he
felt
as
though
someone
had
taken
a
sickle
thrust
it
into
him
and
turned
it
round
several
times
in
his
breast
and
bowels
he
bit
the
pillow
from
pain
and
clenched
his
teeth
and
all
at
once
through
the
chaos
in
his
brain
there
flashed
the
terrible
unbearable
thought
that
these
people
who
seemed
now
like
black
shadows
in
the
moonlight
had
to
endure
such
pain
day
by
day
for
years
how
could
it
have
happened
that
for
more
than
twenty
years
he
had
not
known
it
and
had
refused
to
know
it
he
knew
nothing
of
pain
had
no
conception
of
it
so
he
was
not
to
blame
but
his
conscience
as
inexorable
and
as
rough
as
nikita
made
him
turn
cold
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
his
heels
he
leaped
up
tried
to
cry
out
with
all
his
might
and
to
run
in
haste
to
kill
nikita
and
then
hobotov
the
superintendent
and
the
assistant
and
then
himself
but
no
sound
came
from
his
chest
and
his
legs
would
not
obey
him
gasping
for
breath
he
tore
at
the
dressing
gown
and
the
shirt
on
his
breast
rent
them
and
fell
senseless
on
the
bed
xix
next
morning
his
head
ached
there
was
a
droning
in
his
ears
and
a
feeling
of
utter
weakness
all
over
he
was
not
ashamed
at
recalling
his
weakness
the
day
before
he
had
been
cowardly
had
even
been
afraid
of
the
moon
had
openly
expressed
thoughts
and
feelings
such
as
he
had
not
expected
in
himself
before
for
instance
the
thought
that
the
paltry
people
who
philosophized
were
really
dissatisfied
but
now
nothing
mattered
to
him
he
ate
nothing
he
drank
nothing
he
lay
motionless
and
silent
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
he
thought
when
they
asked
him
questions
i
am
not
going
to
answer
it
s
all
the
same
to
me
after
dinner
mihail
averyanitch
brought
him
a
quarter
pound
of
tea
and
a
pound
of
fruit
pastilles
daryushka
came
too
and
stood
for
a
whole
hour
by
the
bed
with
an
expression
of
dull
grief
on
her
face
dr
hobotov
visited
him
he
brought
a
bottle
of
bromide
and
told
nikita
to
fumigate
the
ward
with
something
towards
evening
andrey
yefimitch
died
of
an
apoplectic
stroke
at
first
he
had
a
violent
shivering
fit
and
a
feeling
of
sickness
something
revolting
as
it
seemed
penetrating
through
his
whole
body
even
to
his
finger
tips
strained
from
his
stomach
to
his
head
and
flooded
his
eyes
and
ears
there
was
a
greenness
before
his
eyes
andrey
yefimitch
understood
that
his
end
had
come
and
remembered
that
ivan
dmitritch
mihail
averyanitch
and
millions
of
people
believed
in
immortality
and
what
if
it
really
existed
but
he
did
not
want
immortality
and
he
thought
of
it
only
for
one
instant
a
herd
of
deer
extraordinarily
beautiful
and
graceful
of
which
he
had
been
reading
the
day
before
ran
by
him
then
a
peasant
woman
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
registered
letter
mihail
averyanitch
said
something
then
it
all
vanished
and
andrey
yefimitch
sank
into
oblivion
for
ever
the
hospital
porters
came
took
him
by
his
arms
and
legs
and
carried
him
away
to
the
chapel
there
he
lay
on
the
table
with
open
eyes
and
the
moon
shed
its
light
upon
him
at
night
in
the
morning
sergey
sergeyitch
came
prayed
piously
before
the
crucifix
and
closed
his
former
chief
s
eyes
next
day
andrey
yefimitch
was
buried
mihail
averyanitch
and
daryushka
were
the
only
people
at
the
funeral
the
petchenyeg
ivan
abramitch
zhmuhin
a
retired
cossack
officer
who
had
once
served
in
the
caucasus
but
now
lived
on
his
own
farm
and
who
had
once
been
young
strong
and
vigorous
but
now
was
old
dried
up
and
bent
with
shaggy
eyebrows
and
a
greenish
grey
moustache
was
returning
from
the
town
to
his
farm
one
hot
summer
s
day
in
the
town
he
had
confessed
and
received
absolution
and
had
made
his
will
at
the
notary
s
a
fortnight
before
he
had
had
a
slight
stroke
and
now
all
the
while
he
was
in
the
railway
carriage
he
was
haunted
by
melancholy
serious
thoughts
of
approaching
death
of
the
vanity
of
vanities
of
the
transitoriness
of
all
things
earthly
at
the
station
of
provalye
there
is
such
a
one
on
the
donetz
line
a
fair
haired
plump
middle
aged
gentleman
with
a
shabby
portfolio
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
sat
down
opposite
they
got
into
conversation
yes
said
ivan
abramitch
looking
pensively
out
of
window
it
is
never
too
late
to
marry
i
myself
married
when
i
was
forty
eight
i
was
told
it
was
late
but
it
has
turned
out
that
it
was
not
late
or
early
but
simply
that
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
marry
at
all
everyone
is
soon
tired
of
his
wife
but
not
everyone
tells
the
truth
because
you
know
people
are
ashamed
of
an
unhappy
home
life
and
conceal
it
it
s
manya
this
and
manya
that
with
many
a
man
by
his
wife
s
side
but
if
he
had
his
way
he
d
put
that
manya
in
a
sack
and
drop
her
in
the
water
it
s
dull
with
one
s
wife
it
s
mere
foolishness
and
it
s
no
better
with
one
s
children
i
make
bold
to
assure
you
i
have
two
of
them
the
rascals
there
s
nowhere
for
them
to
be
taught
out
here
in
the
steppe
i
haven
t
the
money
to
send
them
to
school
in
novo
tcherkask
and
they
live
here
like
young
wolves
next
thing
they
will
be
murdering
someone
on
the
highroad
the
fair
haired
gentleman
listened
attentively
answered
questions
briefly
in
a
low
voice
and
was
apparently
a
gentleman
of
gentle
and
modest
disposition
he
mentioned
that
he
was
a
lawyer
and
that
he
was
going
to
the
village
dyuevka
on
business
why
merciful
heavens
that
is
six
miles
from
me
said
zhmuhin
in
a
tone
of
voice
as
though
someone
were
disputing
with
him
but
excuse
me
you
won
t
find
horses
at
the
station
now
to
my
mind
the
very
best
thing
you
can
do
you
know
is
to
come
straight
to
me
stay
the
night
you
know
and
in
the
morning
drive
over
with
my
horses
the
lawyer
thought
a
moment
and
accepted
the
invitation
when
they
reached
the
station
the
sun
was
already
low
over
the
steppe
they
said
nothing
all
the
way
from
the
station
to
the
farm
the
jolting
prevented
conversation
the
trap
bounded
up
and
down
squeaked
and
seemed
to
be
sobbing
and
the
lawyer
who
was
sitting
very
uncomfortably
stared
before
him
miserably
hoping
to
see
the
farm
after
they
had
driven
five
or
six
miles
there
came
into
view
in
the
distance
a
low
pitched
house
and
a
yard
enclosed
by
a
fence
made
of
dark
flat
stones
standing
on
end
the
roof
was
green
the
stucco
was
peeling
off
and
the
windows
were
little
narrow
slits
like
screwed
up
eyes
the
farm
stood
in
the
full
sunshine
and
there
was
no
sign
either
of
water
or
trees
anywhere
round
among
the
neighbouring
landowners
and
the
peasants
it
was
known
as
the
petchenyegs
farm
many
years
before
a
land
surveyor
who
was
passing
through
the
neighbourhood
and
put
up
at
the
farm
spent
the
whole
night
talking
to
ivan
abramitch
was
not
favourably
impressed
and
as
he
was
driving
away
in
the
morning
said
to
him
grimly
you
are
a
petchenyeg
my
good
sir
the
petchenyegs
were
a
tribe
of
wild
mongolian
nomads
who
made
frequent
inroads
upon
the
russians
in
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
translator
s
note
from
this
came
the
nickname
the
petchenyegs
farm
which
stuck
to
the
place
even
more
when
zhmuhin
s
boys
grew
up
and
began
to
make
raids
on
the
orchards
and
kitchen
gardens
ivan
abramitch
was
called
you
know
as
he
usually
talked
a
very
great
deal
and
frequently
made
use
of
that
expression
in
the
yard
near
a
barn
zhmuhin
s
sons
were
standing
one
a
young
man
of
nineteen
the
other
a
younger
lad
both
barefoot
and
bareheaded
just
at
the
moment
when
the
trap
drove
into
the
yard
the
younger
one
flung
high
up
a
hen
which
cackling
described
an
arc
in
the
air
the
elder
shot
at
it
with
a
gun
and
the
hen
fell
dead
on
the
earth
those
are
my
boys
learning
to
shoot
birds
flying
said
zhmuhin
in
the
entry
the
travellers
were
met
by
a
little
thin
woman
with
a
pale
face
still
young
and
beautiful
from
her
dress
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
servant
and
this
allow
me
to
introduce
her
said
zhmuhin
is
the
mother
of
my
young
cubs
come
lyubov
osipovna
he
said
addressing
her
you
must
be
spry
mother
and
get
something
for
our
guest
let
us
have
supper
look
sharp
the
house
consisted
of
two
parts
in
one
was
the
parlour
and
beside
it
old
zhmuhin
s
bedroom
both
stuffy
rooms
with
low
ceilings
and
multitudes
of
flies
and
wasps
and
in
the
other
was
the
kitchen
in
which
the
cooking
and
washing
was
done
and
the
labourers
had
their
meals
here
geese
and
turkey
hens
were
sitting
on
their
eggs
under
the
benches
and
here
were
the
beds
of
lyubov
osipovna
and
her
two
sons
the
furniture
in
the
parlour
was
unpainted
and
evidently
roughly
made
by
a
carpenter
guns
game
bags
and
whips
were
hanging
on
the
walls
and
all
this
old
rubbish
was
covered
with
the
rust
of
years
and
looked
grey
with
dust
there
was
not
one
picture
in
the
corner
was
a
dingy
board
which
had
at
one
time
been
an
ikon
a
young
little
russian
woman
laid
the
table
and
handed
ham
then
beetroot
soup
the
visitor
refused
vodka
and
ate
only
bread
and
cucumbers
how
about
ham
asked
zhmuhin
thank
you
i
don
t
eat
it
answered
the
visitor
i
don
t
eat
meat
at
all
why
is
that
i
am
a
vegetarian
killing
animals
is
against
my
principles
zhmuhin
thought
a
minute
and
then
said
slowly
with
a
sigh
yes
to
be
sure
i
saw
a
man
who
did
not
eat
meat
in
town
too
it
s
a
new
religion
they
ve
got
now
well
it
s
good
we
can
t
go
on
always
shooting
and
slaughtering
you
know
we
must
give
it
up
some
day
and
leave
even
the
beasts
in
peace
it
s
a
sin
to
kill
it
s
a
sin
there
is
no
denying
it
sometimes
one
kills
a
hare
and
wounds
him
in
the
leg
and
he
cries
like
a
child
so
it
must
hurt
him
of
course
it
hurts
him
animals
suffer
just
like
human
beings
that
s
true
zhmuhin
assented
i
understand
that
very
well
he
went
on
musing
only
there
is
this
one
thing
i
don
t
understand
suppose
you
know
everyone
gave
up
eating
meat
what
would
become
of
the
domestic
animals
fowls
and
geese
for
instance
fowls
and
geese
would
live
in
freedom
like
wild
birds
now
i
understand
to
be
sure
crows
and
jackdaws
get
on
all
right
without
us
yes
fowls
and
geese
and
hares
and
sheep
all
will
live
in
freedom
rejoicing
you
know
and
praising
god
and
they
will
not
fear
us
peace
and
concord
will
come
only
there
is
one
thing
you
know
i
can
t
understand
zhmuhin
went
on
glancing
at
the
ham
how
will
it
be
with
the
pigs
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
they
will
be
like
all
the
rest
that
is
they
will
live
in
freedom
ah
yes
but
allow
me
to
say
if
they
were
not
slaughtered
they
would
multiply
you
know
and
then
good
bye
to
the
kitchen
gardens
and
the
meadows
why
a
pig
if
you
let
it
free
and
don
t
look
after
it
will
ruin
everything
in
a
day
a
pig
is
a
pig
and
it
is
not
for
nothing
it
is
called
a
pig
they
finished
supper
zhmuhin
got
up
from
the
table
and
for
a
long
while
walked
up
and
down
the
room
talking
and
talking
he
was
fond
of
talking
of
something
important
or
serious
and
was
fond
of
meditating
and
in
his
old
age
he
had
a
longing
to
reach
some
haven
to
be
reassured
that
he
might
not
be
so
frightened
of
dying
he
had
a
longing
for
meekness
spiritual
calm
and
confidence
in
himself
such
as
this
guest
of
theirs
had
who
had
satisfied
his
hunger
on
cucumbers
and
bread
and
believed
that
doing
so
made
him
more
perfect
he
was
sitting
on
a
chest
plump
and
healthy
keeping
silent
and
patiently
enduring
his
boredom
and
in
the
dusk
when
one
glanced
at
him
from
the
entry
he
looked
like
a
big
round
stone
which
one
could
not
move
from
its
place
if
a
man
has
something
to
lay
hold
of
in
life
he
is
all
right
zhmuhin
went
through
the
entry
to
the
porch
and
then
he
could
be
heard
sighing
and
saying
reflectively
to
himself
yes
to
be
sure
by
now
it
was
dark
and
here
and
there
stars
could
be
seen
in
the
sky
they
had
not
yet
lighted
up
indoors
someone
came
into
the
parlour
as
noiselessly
as
a
shadow
and
stood
still
near
the
door
it
was
lyubov
osipovna
zhmuhin
s
wife
are
you
from
the
town
she
asked
timidly
not
looking
at
her
visitor
yes
i
live
in
the
town
perhaps
you
are
something
in
the
learned
way
sir
be
so
kind
as
to
advise
us
we
ought
to
send
in
a
petition
to
whom
asked
the
visitor
we
have
two
sons
kind
gentleman
and
they
ought
to
have
been
sent
to
school
long
ago
but
we
never
see
anyone
and
have
no
one
to
advise
us
and
i
know
nothing
for
if
they
are
not
taught
they
will
have
to
serve
in
the
army
as
common
cossacks
it
s
not
right
sir
they
can
t
read
and
write
they
are
worse
than
peasants
and
ivan
abramitch
himself
can
t
stand
them
and
won
t
let
them
indoors
but
they
are
not
to
blame
the
younger
one
at
any
rate
ought
to
be
sent
to
school
it
is
such
a
pity
she
said
slowly
and
there
was
a
quiver
in
her
voice
and
it
seemed
incredible
that
a
woman
so
small
and
so
youthful
could
have
grown
up
children
oh
it
s
such
a
pity
you
don
t
know
anything
about
it
mother
and
it
is
not
your
affair
said
zhmuhin
appearing
in
the
doorway
don
t
pester
our
guest
with
your
wild
talk
go
away
mother
lyubov
osipovna
went
out
and
in
the
entry
repeated
once
more
in
a
thin
little
voice
oh
it
s
such
a
pity
a
bed
was
made
up
for
the
visitor
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlour
and
that
it
might
not
be
dark
for
him
they
lighted
the
lamp
before
the
ikon
zhmuhin
went
to
bed
in
his
own
room
and
as
he
lay
there
he
thought
of
his
soul
of
his
age
of
his
recent
stroke
which
had
so
frightened
him
and
made
him
think
of
death
he
was
fond
of
philosophizing
when
he
was
in
quietness
by
himself
and
then
he
fancied
that
he
was
a
very
earnest
deep
thinker
and
that
nothing
in
this
world
interested
him
but
serious
questions
and
now
he
kept
thinking
and
he
longed
to
pitch
upon
some
one
significant
thought
unlike
others
which
would
be
a
guide
to
him
in
life
and
he
wanted
to
think
out
principles
of
some
sort
for
himself
so
as
to
make
his
life
as
deep
and
earnest
as
he
imagined
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
an
old
man
like
him
to
abstain
altogether
from
meat
from
superfluities
of
all
sorts
the
time
when
men
give
up
killing
each
other
and
animals
would
come
sooner
or
later
it
could
not
but
be
so
and
he
imagined
that
time
to
himself
and
clearly
pictured
himself
living
in
peace
with
all
the
animals
and
suddenly
he
thought
again
of
the
pigs
and
everything
was
in
a
tangle
in
his
brain
it
s
a
queer
business
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
he
muttered
sighing
heavily
are
you
asleep
he
asked
no
zhmuhin
got
out
of
bed
and
stopped
in
the
doorway
with
nothing
but
his
shirt
on
displaying
to
his
guest
his
sinewy
legs
that
looked
as
dry
as
sticks
nowadays
you
know
he
began
all
sorts
of
telegraphs
telephones
and
marvels
of
all
kinds
in
fact
have
come
in
but
people
are
no
better
than
they
were
they
say
that
in
our
day
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
men
were
coarse
and
cruel
but
isn
t
it
just
the
same
now
we
certainly
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
in
our
day
i
remember
in
the
caucasus
when
we
were
stationed
by
a
little
river
with
nothing
to
do
for
four
whole
months
i
was
an
under
officer
at
that
time
something
queer
happened
quite
in
the
style
of
a
novel
just
on
the
banks
of
that
river
you
know
where
our
division
was
encamped
a
wretched
prince
whom
we
had
killed
not
long
before
was
buried
and
at
night
you
know
the
princess
used
to
come
to
his
grave
and
weep
she
would
wail
and
wail
and
moan
and
moan
and
make
us
so
depressed
we
couldn
t
sleep
and
that
s
the
fact
we
couldn
t
sleep
one
night
we
couldn
t
sleep
a
second
well
we
got
sick
of
it
and
from
a
common
sense
point
of
view
you
really
can
t
go
without
your
sleep
for
the
devil
knows
what
excuse
the
expression
we
took
that
princess
and
gave
her
a
good
thrashing
and
she
gave
up
coming
there
s
an
instance
for
you
nowadays
of
course
there
is
not
the
same
class
of
people
and
they
are
not
given
to
thrashing
and
they
live
in
cleaner
style
and
there
is
more
learning
but
you
know
the
soul
is
just
the
same
there
is
no
change
now
look
here
there
s
a
landowner
living
here
among
us
he
has
mines
you
know
all
sorts
of
tramps
without
passports
who
don
t
know
where
to
go
work
for
him
on
saturdays
he
has
to
settle
up
with
the
workmen
but
he
doesn
t
care
to
pay
them
you
know
he
grudges
the
money
so
he
s
got
hold
of
a
foreman
who
is
a
tramp
too
though
he
does
wear
a
hat
don
t
you
pay
them
anything
he
says
not
a
kopeck
they
ll
beat
you
and
let
them
beat
you
says
he
but
you
put
up
with
it
and
i
ll
pay
you
ten
roubles
every
saturday
for
it
so
on
the
saturday
evening
the
workmen
come
to
settle
up
in
the
usual
way
the
foreman
says
to
them
nothing
well
word
for
word
as
the
master
said
they
begin
swearing
and
using
their
fists
they
beat
him
and
they
kick
him
you
know
they
are
a
set
of
men
brutalized
by
hunger
they
beat
him
till
he
is
senseless
and
then
they
go
each
on
his
way
the
master
gives
orders
for
cold
water
to
be
poured
on
the
foreman
then
flings
ten
roubles
in
his
face
and
he
takes
it
and
is
pleased
too
for
indeed
he
d
be
ready
to
be
hanged
for
three
roubles
let
alone
ten
yes
and
on
monday
a
new
gang
of
workmen
arrive
they
work
for
they
have
nowhere
to
go
on
saturday
it
is
the
same
story
over
again
the
visitor
turned
over
on
the
other
side
with
his
face
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
muttered
something
and
here
s
another
instance
zhmuhin
went
on
we
had
the
siberian
plague
here
you
know
the
cattle
die
off
like
flies
i
can
tell
you
and
the
veterinary
surgeons
came
here
and
strict
orders
were
given
that
the
dead
cattle
were
to
be
buried
at
a
distance
deep
in
the
earth
that
lime
was
to
be
thrown
over
them
and
so
on
you
know
on
scientific
principles
my
horse
died
too
i
buried
it
with
every
precaution
and
threw
over
three
hundredweight
of
lime
over
it
and
what
do
you
think
my
fine
fellows
my
precious
sons
i
mean
dug
it
up
skinned
it
and
sold
the
hide
for
three
roubles
there
s
an
instance
for
you
so
people
have
grown
no
better
and
however
you
feed
a
wolf
he
will
always
look
towards
the
forest
there
it
is
it
gives
one
something
to
think
about
eh
how
do
you
look
at
it
on
one
side
a
flash
of
lightning
gleamed
through
a
chink
in
the
window
blinds
there
was
the
stifling
feeling
of
a
storm
coming
the
gnats
were
biting
and
zhmuhin
as
he
lay
in
his
bedroom
meditating
sighed
and
groaned
and
said
to
himself
yes
to
be
sure
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
to
sleep
somewhere
far
far
away
there
was
a
growl
of
thunder
are
you
asleep
no
answered
the
visitor
zhmuhin
got
up
and
thudding
with
his
heels
walked
through
the
parlour
and
the
entry
to
the
kitchen
to
get
a
drink
of
water
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
you
know
is
stupidity
he
said
a
little
later
coming
back
with
a
dipper
my
lyubov
osipovna
is
on
her
knees
saying
her
prayers
she
prays
every
night
you
know
and
bows
down
to
the
ground
first
that
her
children
may
be
sent
to
school
she
is
afraid
her
boys
will
go
into
the
army
as
simple
cossacks
and
that
they
will
be
whacked
across
their
backs
with
sabres
but
for
teaching
one
must
have
money
and
where
is
one
to
get
it
you
may
break
the
floor
beating
your
head
against
it
but
if
you
haven
t
got
it
you
haven
t
and
the
other
reason
she
prays
is
because
you
know
every
woman
imagines
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
as
unhappy
as
she
is
i
am
a
plain
spoken
man
and
i
don
t
want
to
conceal
anything
from
you
she
comes
of
a
poor
family
a
village
priest
s
daughter
i
married
her
when
she
was
seventeen
and
they
accepted
my
offer
chiefly
because
they
hadn
t
enough
to
eat
it
was
nothing
but
poverty
and
misery
while
i
have
anyway
land
you
see
a
farm
and
after
all
i
am
an
officer
it
was
a
step
up
for
her
to
marry
me
you
know
on
the
very
first
day
when
she
was
married
she
cried
and
she
has
been
crying
ever
since
all
these
twenty
years
she
has
got
a
watery
eye
and
she
s
always
sitting
and
thinking
and
what
do
you
suppose
she
is
thinking
about
what
can
a
woman
think
about
why
nothing
i
must
own
i
don
t
consider
a
woman
a
human
being
the
visitor
got
up
abruptly
and
sat
on
the
bed
excuse
me
i
feel
stifled
he
said
i
will
go
outside
zhmuhin
still
talking
about
women
drew
the
bolt
in
the
entry
and
they
both
went
out
a
full
moon
was
floating
in
the
sky
just
over
the
yard
and
in
the
moonlight
the
house
and
barn
looked
whiter
than
by
day
and
on
the
grass
brilliant
streaks
of
moonlight
white
too
stretched
between
the
black
shadows
far
away
on
the
right
could
be
seen
the
steppe
above
it
the
stars
were
softly
glowing
and
it
was
all
mysterious
infinitely
far
away
as
though
one
were
gazing
into
a
deep
abyss
while
on
the
left
heavy
storm
clouds
black
as
soot
were
piling
up
one
upon
another
above
the
steppe
their
edges
were
lighted
up
by
the
moon
and
it
looked
as
though
there
were
mountains
there
with
white
snow
on
their
peaks
dark
forests
the
sea
there
was
a
flash
of
lightning
a
faint
rumble
of
thunder
and
it
seemed
as
though
a
battle
were
being
fought
in
the
mountains
quite
close
to
the
house
a
little
night
owl
screeched
monotonously
asleep
asleep
what
time
is
it
now
asked
the
visitor
just
after
one
how
long
it
is
still
to
dawn
they
went
back
to
the
house
and
lay
down
again
it
was
time
to
sleep
and
one
can
usually
sleep
so
splendidly
before
rain
but
the
old
man
had
a
hankering
after
serious
weighty
thoughts
he
wanted
not
simply
to
think
but
to
meditate
and
he
meditated
how
good
it
would
be
as
death
was
near
at
hand
for
the
sake
of
his
soul
to
give
up
the
idleness
which
so
imperceptibly
swallowed
up
day
after
day
year
after
year
leaving
no
trace
to
think
out
for
himself
some
great
exploit
for
instance
to
walk
on
foot
far
far
away
or
to
give
up
meat
like
this
young
man
and
again
he
pictured
to
himself
the
time
when
animals
would
not
be
killed
pictured
it
clearly
and
distinctly
as
though
he
were
living
through
that
time
himself
but
suddenly
it
was
all
in
a
tangle
again
in
his
head
and
all
was
muddled
the
thunderstorm
had
passed
over
but
from
the
edges
of
the
storm
clouds
came
rain
softly
pattering
on
the
roof
zhmuhin
got
up
stretching
and
groaning
with
old
age
and
looked
into
the
parlour
noticing
that
his
visitor
was
not
asleep
he
said
when
we
were
in
the
caucasus
you
know
there
was
a
colonel
there
who
was
a
vegetarian
too
he
didn
t
eat
meat
never
went
shooting
and
would
not
let
his
servants
catch
fish
of
course
i
understand
that
every
animal
ought
to
live
in
freedom
and
enjoy
its
life
only
i
don
t
understand
how
a
pig
can
go
about
where
it
likes
without
being
looked
after
the
visitor
got
up
and
sat
down
his
pale
haggard
face
expressed
weariness
and
vexation
it
was
evident
that
he
was
exhausted
and
only
his
gentleness
and
the
delicacy
of
his
soul
prevented
him
from
expressing
his
vexation
in
words
it
s
getting
light
he
said
mildly
please
have
the
horse
brought
round
for
me
why
so
wait
a
little
and
the
rain
will
be
over
no
i
entreat
you
said
the
visitor
in
horror
with
a
supplicating
voice
it
is
essential
for
me
to
go
at
once
and
he
began
hurriedly
dressing
by
the
time
the
horse
was
harnessed
the
sun
was
rising
it
had
just
left
off
raining
the
clouds
were
racing
swiftly
by
and
the
patches
of
blue
were
growing
bigger
and
bigger
in
the
sky
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
were
timidly
reflected
below
in
the
big
puddles
the
visitor
walked
through
the
entry
with
his
portfolio
to
get
into
the
trap
and
at
that
moment
zhmuhin
s
wife
pale
and
it
seemed
paler
than
the
day
before
with
tear
stained
eyes
looked
at
him
intently
without
balinking
with
the
na
ve
expression
of
a
little
girl
and
it
was
evident
from
her
dejected
face
that
she
was
envying
him
his
freedom
oh
with
what
joy
she
would
have
gone
away
from
there
and
she
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
most
likely
to
ask
advice
about
her
children
and
what
a
pitiable
figure
she
was
this
was
not
a
wife
not
the
head
of
a
house
not
even
a
servant
but
more
like
a
dependent
a
poor
relation
not
wanted
by
anyone
a
nonentity
her
husband
fussing
about
talking
unceasingly
was
seeing
his
visitor
off
continually
running
in
front
of
him
while
she
huddled
up
to
the
wall
with
a
timid
guilty
air
waiting
for
a
convenient
minute
to
speak
please
come
again
another
time
the
old
man
kept
repeating
incessantly
what
we
have
we
are
glad
to
offer
you
know
the
visitor
hurriedly
got
into
the
trap
evidently
with
relief
as
though
he
were
afraid
every
minute
that
they
would
detain
him
the
trap
lurched
about
as
it
had
the
day
before
squeaked
and
furiously
rattled
the
pail
that
was
tied
on
at
the
back
he
glanced
round
at
zhmuhin
with
a
peculiar
expression
it
looked
as
though
he
wanted
to
call
him
a
petchenyeg
as
the
surveyor
had
once
done
or
some
such
name
but
his
gentleness
got
the
upper
hand
he
controlled
himself
and
said
nothing
but
in
the
gateway
he
suddenly
could
not
restrain
himself
he
got
up
and
shouted
loudly
and
angrily
you
have
bored
me
to
death
and
he
disappeared
through
the
gate
near
the
barn
zhmuhin
s
sons
were
standing
the
elder
held
a
gun
while
the
younger
had
in
his
hands
a
grey
cockerel
with
a
bright
red
comb
the
younger
flung
up
the
cockerel
with
all
his
might
the
bird
flew
upwards
higher
than
the
house
and
turned
over
in
the
air
like
a
pigeon
the
elder
boy
fired
and
the
cockerel
fell
like
a
stone
the
old
man
overcome
with
confusion
not
knowing
how
to
explain
the
visitor
s
strange
unexpected
shout
went
slowly
back
into
the
house
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
he
spent
a
long
while
meditating
on
the
intellectual
tendencies
of
the
day
on
the
universal
immorality
on
the
telegraph
on
the
telephone
on
velocipedes
on
how
unnecessary
it
all
was
little
by
little
he
regained
his
composure
then
slowly
had
a
meal
drank
five
glasses
of
tea
and
lay
down
for
a
nap
a
dead
body
a
still
august
night
a
mist
is
rising
slowly
from
the
fields
and
casting
an
opaque
veil
over
everything
within
eyesight
lighted
up
by
the
moon
the
mist
gives
the
impression
at
one
moment
of
a
calm
boundless
sea
at
the
next
of
an
immense
white
wall
the
air
is
damp
and
chilly
morning
is
still
far
off
a
step
from
the
bye
road
which
runs
along
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
little
fire
is
gleaming
a
dead
body
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
new
white
linen
is
lying
under
a
young
oak
tree
a
wooden
ikon
is
lying
on
its
breast
beside
the
corpse
almost
on
the
road
sits
the
watch
two
peasants
performing
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
and
uninviting
of
peasants
duties
one
a
tall
young
fellow
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
moustache
and
thick
black
eyebrows
in
a
tattered
sheepskin
and
bark
shoes
is
sitting
on
the
wet
grass
his
feet
stuck
out
straight
in
front
of
him
and
is
trying
to
while
away
the
time
with
work
he
bends
his
long
neck
and
breathing
loudly
through
his
nose
makes
a
spoon
out
of
a
big
crooked
bit
of
wood
the
other
a
little
scraggy
pock
marked
peasant
with
an
aged
face
a
scanty
moustache
and
a
little
goat
s
beard
sits
with
his
hands
dangling
loose
on
his
knees
and
without
moving
gazes
listlessly
at
the
light
a
small
camp
fire
is
lazily
burning
down
between
them
throwing
a
red
glow
on
their
faces
there
is
perfect
stillness
the
only
sounds
are
the
scrape
of
the
knife
on
the
wood
and
the
crackling
of
damp
sticks
in
the
fire
don
t
you
go
to
sleep
syoma
says
the
young
man
i
i
am
not
asleep
stammers
the
goat
beard
that
s
all
right
it
would
be
dreadful
to
sit
here
alone
one
would
be
frightened
you
might
tell
me
something
syoma
you
are
a
queer
fellow
syomushka
other
people
will
laugh
and
tell
a
story
and
sing
a
song
but
you
there
is
no
making
you
out
you
sit
like
a
scarecrow
in
the
garden
and
roll
your
eyes
at
the
fire
you
can
t
say
anything
properly
when
you
speak
you
seem
frightened
i
dare
say
you
are
fifty
but
you
have
less
sense
than
a
child
aren
t
you
sorry
that
you
are
a
simpleton
i
am
sorry
the
goat
beard
answers
gloomily
and
we
are
sorry
to
see
your
foolishness
you
may
be
sure
you
are
a
good
natured
sober
peasant
and
the
only
trouble
is
that
you
have
no
sense
in
your
head
you
should
have
picked
up
some
sense
for
yourself
if
the
lord
has
afflicted
you
and
given
you
no
understanding
you
must
make
an
effort
syoma
you
should
listen
hard
when
anything
good
s
being
said
note
it
well
and
keep
thinking
and
thinking
if
there
is
any
word
you
don
t
understand
you
should
make
an
effort
and
think
over
in
your
head
in
what
meaning
the
word
is
used
do
you
see
make
an
effort
if
you
don
t
gain
some
sense
for
yourself
you
ll
be
a
simpleton
and
of
no
account
at
all
to
your
dying
day
all
at
once
a
long
drawn
out
moaning
sound
is
heard
in
the
forest
something
rustles
in
the
leaves
as
though
torn
from
the
very
top
of
the
tree
and
falls
to
the
ground
all
this
is
faintly
repeated
by
the
echo
the
young
man
shudders
and
looks
enquiringly
at
his
companion
it
s
an
owl
at
the
little
birds
says
syoma
gloomily
why
syoma
it
s
time
for
the
birds
to
fly
to
the
warm
countries
to
be
sure
it
is
time
it
is
chilly
at
dawn
now
it
is
co
old
the
crane
is
a
chilly
creature
it
is
tender
such
cold
is
death
to
it
i
am
not
a
crane
but
i
am
frozen
put
some
more
wood
on
syoma
gets
up
and
disappears
in
the
dark
undergrowth
while
he
is
busy
among
the
bushes
breaking
dry
twigs
his
companion
puts
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
starts
at
every
sound
syoma
brings
an
armful
of
wood
and
lays
it
on
the
fire
the
flame
irresolutely
licks
the
black
twigs
with
its
little
tongues
then
suddenly
as
though
at
the
word
of
command
catches
them
and
throws
a
crimson
light
on
the
faces
the
road
the
white
linen
with
its
prominences
where
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
corpse
raise
it
the
ikon
the
watch
is
silent
the
young
man
bends
his
neck
still
lower
and
sets
to
work
with
still
more
nervous
haste
the
goat
beard
sits
motionless
as
before
and
keeps
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
ye
that
love
not
zion
shall
be
put
to
shame
by
the
lord
a
falsetto
voice
is
suddenly
heard
singing
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
then
slow
footsteps
are
audible
and
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
in
a
short
monkish
cassock
and
a
broad
brimmed
hat
with
a
wallet
on
his
shoulders
comes
into
sight
on
the
road
in
the
crimson
firelight
thy
will
be
done
o
lord
holy
mother
the
figure
says
in
a
husky
falsetto
i
saw
the
fire
in
the
outer
darkness
and
my
soul
leapt
for
joy
at
first
i
thought
it
was
men
grazing
a
drove
of
horses
then
i
thought
it
can
t
be
that
since
no
horses
were
to
be
seen
aren
t
they
thieves
i
wondered
aren
t
they
robbers
lying
in
wait
for
a
rich
lazarus
aren
t
they
the
gypsy
people
offering
sacrifices
to
idols
and
my
soul
leapt
for
joy
go
feodosy
servant
of
god
i
said
to
myself
and
win
a
martyr
s
crown
and
i
flew
to
the
fire
like
a
light
winged
moth
now
i
stand
before
you
and
from
your
outer
aspect
i
judge
of
your
souls
you
are
not
thieves
and
you
are
not
heathens
peace
be
to
you
good
evening
good
orthodox
people
do
you
know
how
to
reach
the
makuhinsky
brickyards
from
here
it
s
close

go
straight
along
the
road
when
you
have
gone
a
mile
and
a
half
there
will
be
ananova
our
village
from
the
village

two
miles
from
ananova

you
health
and
why
are
you
sitting
here

are
sitting
here
watching
you
see
there
is
a
dead
body
what
what
body
holy
mother
the
pilgrim
sees
the
white
linen
with
the
ikon
on
it
and
starts
so
violently
that
his
legs
give
a
little
skip
this
unexpected
sight
has
an
overpowering
effect
upon
him
he
huddles
together
and
stands
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
with
wide
open
mouth
and
staring
eyes
for
three
minutes
he
is
silent
as
though
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
then
begins
muttering
o
lord
holy
mother
i
was
going
along
not
meddling
with
anyone
and
all
at
once
such
an
affliction
what
may
you
be
enquires
the
young
man
of
the
clergy
no

go
from
one
monastery
to
another

mi
mihail
polikarpitch

nephew

are
watching

the
man
in
the
cassock
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
where
did
the
deceased
come
from
he
was
a
stranger
such
is
life
but
i
ll
er
be
getting
on
brothers
i
feel
flustered
i
am
more
afraid
of
the
dead
than
of
anything
my
dear
souls
and
only
fancy
while
this
man
was
alive
he
wasn
t
noticed
while
now
when
he
is
dead
and
given
over
to
corruption
we
tremble
before
him
as
before
some
famous
general
or
a
bishop
such
is
life
was
he
murdered
or
what
the
lord
knows
maybe
he
was
murdered
or
maybe
he
died
of
himself
yes
yes
who
knows
brothers
maybe
his
soul
is
now
tasting
the
joys
of
paradise
his
soul
is
still
hovering
here
near
his
body
says
the
young
man
it
does
not
depart
from
the
body
for
three
days
h
m
yes
how
chilly
the
nights
are
now
it
sets
one
s
teeth
chattering
so
then
i
am
to
go
straight
on
and
on
till
you
get
to
the
village
and
then
you
turn
to
the
right
by
the
river
bank
by
the
river
bank
to
be
sure
why
am
i
standing
still
i
must
go
on
farewell
brothers
the
man
in
the
cassock
takes
five
steps
along
the
road
and
stops
i
ve
forgotten
to
put
a
kopeck
for
the
burying
he
says
good
orthodox
friends

i
give
the
money
you
ought
to
know
best
you
go
the
round
of
the
monasteries
if
he
died
a
natural
death
it
would
go
for
the
good
of
his
soul
if
it
s
a
suicide
it
s
a
sin
that
s
true
and
maybe
it
really
was
a
suicide
so
i
had
better

my
money

give
me
a
thousand
roubles
and
i
would
not
consent
to
sit

and
stops
again

make
up
my
mind

am
to
do
he
mutters
to
stay
here
by

dreadful
that

afraid
of

man

up
and
goes
with
the
cassock
a
minute
later
the
sound
of
their
steps
and
their
talk
dies
away
syoma
shuts
his
eyes
and
gently
dozes
the
fire
begins
to
grow
dim
and
a
big
black
shadow
falls
on
the
dead
body
a
happy
ending
lyubov
grigoryevna
a
substantial
buxom
lady
of
forty
who
undertook
matchmaking
and
many
other
matters
of
which
it
is
usual
to
speak
only
in
whispers
had
come
to
see
stytchkin
the
head
guard
on
a
day
when
he
was
off
duty
stytchkin
somewhat
embarrassed
but
as
always
grave
practical
and
severe
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
smoking
a
cigar
and
saying
very
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
semyon
ivanovitch
recommended
you
on
the
ground
that
you
may
be
able
to
assist
me
in
a
delicate
and
very
important
matter
affecting
the
happiness
of
my
life
i
have
lyubov
grigoryevna
reached
the
age
of
fifty
two
that
is
a
period
of
life
at
which
very
many
have
already
grown
up
children
my
position
is
a
secure
one
though
my
fortune
is
not
large
yet
i
am
in
a
position
to
support
a
beloved
being
and
children
at
my
side
i
may
tell
you
between
ourselves
that
apart
from
my
salary
i
have
also
money
in
the
bank
which
my
manner
of
living
has
enabled
me
to
save
i
am
a
practical
and
sober
man
i
lead
a
sensible
and
consistent
life
so
that
i
may
hold
myself
up
as
an
example
to
many
but
one
thing
i
lack
a
domestic
hearth
of
my
own
and
a
partner
in
life
and
i
live
like
a
wandering
magyar
moving
from
place
to
place
without
any
satisfaction
i
have
no
one
with
whom
to
take
counsel
and
when
i
am
ill
no
one
to
give
me
water
and
so
on
apart
from
that
lyubov
grigoryevna
a
married
man
has
always
more
weight
in
society
than
a
bachelor
i
am
a
man
of
the
educated
class
with
money
but
if
you
look
at
me
from
a
point
of
view
what
am
i
a
man
with
no
kith
and
kin
no
better
than
some
polish
priest
and
therefore
i
should
be
very
desirous
to
be
united
in
the
bonds
of
hymen
that
is
to
enter
into
matrimony
with
some
worthy
person
an
excellent
thing
said
the
matchmaker
with
a
sigh
i
am
a
solitary
man
and
in
this
town
i
know
no
one
where
can
i
go
and
to
whom
can
i
apply
since
all
the
people
here
are
strangers
to
me
that
is
why
semyon
ivanovitch
advised
me
to
address
myself
to
a
person
who
is
a
specialist
in
this
line
and
makes
the
arrangement
of
the
happiness
of
others
her
profession
and
therefore
i
most
earnestly
beg
you
lyubov
grigoryevna
to
assist
me
in
ordering
my
future
you
know
all
the
marriageable
young
ladies
in
the
town
and
it
is
easy
for
you
to
accommodate
me
i
can
a
glass
of
wine
i
beg
you
with
an
habitual
gesture
the
matchmaker
raised
her
glass
to
her
mouth
and
tossed
it
off
without
winking
i
can
she
repeated
and
what
sort
of
bride
would
you
like
nikolay
nikolayitch
should
i
like
the
bride
fate
sends
me
well
of
course
it
depends
on
your
fate
but
everyone
has
his
own
taste
you
know
one
likes
dark
ladies
the
other
prefers
fair
ones
you
see
lyubov
grigoryevna
said
stytchkin
sighing
sedately
i
am
a
practical
man
and
a
man
of
character
for
me
beauty
and
external
appearance
generally
take
a
secondary
place
for
as
you
know
yourself
beauty
is
neither
bowl
nor
platter
and
a
pretty
wife
involves
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
what
matters
most
in
a
woman
is
not
what
is
external
but
what
lies
within
that
is
that
she
should
have
soul
and
all
the
qualities
a
glass
of
wine
i
beg
of
course
it
would
be
very
agreeable
that
one
s
wife
should
be
rather
plump
but
for
mutual
happiness
it
is
not
of
great
consequence
what
matters
is
the
mind
properly
speaking
a
woman
does
not
need
mind
either
for
if
she
has
brains
she
will
have
too
high
an
opinion
of
herself
and
take
all
sorts
of
ideas
into
her
head
one
can
not
do
without
education
nowadays
of
course
but
education
is
of
different
kinds
it
would
be
pleasing
for
one
s
wife
to
know
french
and
german
to
speak
various
languages
very
pleasing
but
what
s
the
use
of
that
if
she
can
t
sew
on
one
s
buttons
perhaps
i
am
a
man
of
the
educated
class
i
am
just
as
much
at
home
i
may
say
with
prince
kanitelin
as
i
am
with
you
here
now
but
my
habits
are
simple
and
i
want
a
girl
who
is
not
too
much
a
fine
lady
above
all
she
must
have
respect
for
me
and
feel
that
i
have
made
her
happiness
to
be
sure
well
now
as
regards
the
essential
i
do
not
want
a
wealthy
bride
i
would
never
condescend
to
anything
so
low
as
to
marry
for
money
i
desire
not
to
be
kept
by
my
wife
but
to
keep
her
and
that
she
may
be
sensible
of
it
but
i
do
not
want
a
poor
girl
either
though
i
am
a
man
of
means
and
am
marrying
not
from
mercenary
motives
but
from
love
yet
i
can
not
take
a
poor
girl
for
as
you
know
yourself
prices
have
gone
up
so
and
there
will
be
children
one
might
find
one
with
a
dowry
said
the
matchmaker
a
glass
of
wine
i
beg
there
was
a
pause
of
five
minutes
the
matchmaker
heaved
a
sigh
took
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
guard
and
asked
well
now
my
good
sir
do
you
want
anything
in
the
bachelor
line
i
have
some
fine
bargains
one
is
a
french
girl
and
one
is
a
greek
well
worth
the
money
the
guard
thought
a
moment
and
said
no
i
thank
you
in
view
of
your
favourable
disposition
allow
me
to
enquire
now
how
much
you
ask
for
your
exertions
in
regard
to
a
bride
i
don
t
ask
much
give
me
twenty
five
roubles
and
the
stuff
for
a
dress
as
is
usual
and
i
will
say
thank
you
but
for
the
dowry
that
s
a
different
account
stytchkin
folded
his
arms
over
his
chest
and
fell
to
pondering
in
silence
after
some
thought
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
said
that
s
dear
it
s
not
at
all
dear
nikolay
nikolayitch
in
old
days
when
there
were
lots
of
weddings
one
did
do
it
cheaper
but
nowadays
what
are
our
earnings
if
you
make
fifty
roubles
in
a
month
that
is
not
a
fast
you
may
be
thankful
it
s
not
on
weddings
we
make
our
money
my
good
sir
stytchkin
looked
at
the
matchmaker
in
amazement
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
h
m
do
you
call
fifty
roubles
little
he
asked
of
course
it
is
little
in
old
days
we
sometimes
made
more
than
a
hundred
h
m
i
should
never
have
thought
it
was
possible
to
earn
such
a
sum
by
these
jobs
fifty
roubles
it
is
not
every
man
that
earns
as
much
pray
drink
your
wine
the
matchmaker
drained
her
glass
without
winking
stytchkin
looked
her
over
from
head
to
foot
in
silence
then
said
fifty
roubles
why
that
is
six
hundred
roubles
a
year
please
take
some
more
with
such
dividends
you
know
lyubov
grigoryevna
you
would
have
no
difficulty
in
making
a
match
for
yourself
for
myself
laughed
the
matchmaker
i
am
an
old
woman
not
at
all
you
have
such
a
figure
and
your
face
is
plump
and
fair
and
all
the
rest
of
it
the
matchmaker
was
embarrassed
stytchkin
was
also
embarrassed
and
sat
down
beside
her
you
are
still
very
attractive
said
he
if
you
met
with
a
practical
steady
careful
husband
with
his
salary
and
your
earnings
you
might
even
attract
him
very
much
and
you
d
get
on
very
well
together
goodness
knows
what
you
are
saying
nikolay
nikolayitch
well
i
meant
no
harm
a
silence
followed
stytchkin
began
loudly
blowing
his
nose
while
the
matchmaker
turned
crimson
and
looking
bashfully
at
him
asked
and
how
much
do
you
get
nikolay
nikolayitch
i
seventy
five
roubles
besides
tips
apart
from
that
we
make
something
out
of
candles
and
hares
you
go
hunting
then
no
passengers
who
travel
without
tickets
are
called
hares
with
us
another
minute
passed
in
silence
stytchkin
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
in
excitement
i
don
t
want
a
young
wife
said
he
i
am
a
middle
aged
man
and
i
want
someone
who
as
it
might
be
like
you
staid
and
settled
and
a
figure
something
like
yours
goodness
knows
what
you
are
saying
giggled
the
matchmaker
hiding
her
crimson
face
in
her
kerchief
there
is
no
need
to
be
long
thinking
about
it
you
are
after
my
own
heart
and
you
suit
me
in
your
qualities
i
am
a
practical
sober
man
and
if
you
like
me
what
could
be
better
allow
me
to
make
you
a
proposal
the
matchmaker
dropped
a
tear
laughed
and
in
token
of
her
consent
calinked
glasses
with
stytchkin
well
said
the
happy
railway
guard
now
allow
me
to
explain
to
you
the
behaviour
and
manner
of
life
i
desire
from
you
i
am
a
strict
respectable
practical
man
i
take
a
gentlemanly
view
of
everything
and
i
desire
that
my
wife
should
be
strict
also
and
should
understand
that
to
her
i
am
a
benefactor
and
the
foremost
person
in
the
world
he
sat
down
and
heaving
a
deep
sigh
began
expounding
to
his
bride
elect
his
views
on
domestic
life
and
a
wife
s
duties
the
looking
glass
new
year
s
eve
nellie
the
daughter
of
a
landowner
and
general
a
young
and
pretty
girl
dreaming
day
and
night
of
being
married
was
sitting
in
her
room
gazing
with
exhausted
half
closed
eyes
into
the
looking
glass
she
was
pale
tense
and
as
motionless
as
the
looking
glass
the
non
existent
but
apparent
vista
of
a
long
narrow
corridor
with
endless
rows
of
candles
the
reflection
of
her
face
her
hands
of
the
frame
all
this
was
already
clouded
in
mist
and
merged
into
a
boundless
grey
sea
the
sea
was
undulating
gleaming
and
now
and
then
flaring
crimson
looking
at
nellie
s
motionless
eyes
and
parted
lips
one
could
hardly
say
whether
she
was
asleep
or
awake
but
nevertheless
she
was
seeing
at
first
she
saw
only
the
smile
and
soft
charming
expression
of
someone
s
eyes
then
against
the
shifting
grey
background
there
gradually
appeared
the
outlines
of
a
head
a
face
eyebrows
beard
it
was
he
the
destined
one
the
object
of
long
dreams
and
hopes
the
destined
one
was
for
nellie
everything
the
significance
of
life
personal
happiness
career
fate
outside
him
as
on
the
grey
background
of
the
looking
glass
all
was
dark
empty
meaningless
and
so
it
was
not
strange
that
seeing
before
her
a
handsome
gently
smiling
face
she
was
conscious
of
bliss
of
an
unutterably
sweet
dream
that
could
not
be
expressed
in
speech
or
on
paper
then
she
heard
his
voice
saw
herself
living
under
the
same
roof
with
him
her
life
merged
into
his
months
and
years
flew
by
against
the
grey
background
and
nellie
saw
her
future
distinctly
in
all
its
details
picture
followed
picture
against
the
grey
background
now
nellie
saw
herself
one
winter
night
knocking
at
the
door
of
stepan
lukitch
the
district
doctor
the
old
dog
hoarsely
and
lazily
barked
behind
the
gate
the
doctor
s
windows
were
in
darkness
all
was
silence
for
god
s
sake
for
god
s
sake
whispered
nellie
but
at
last
the
garden
gate
creaked
and
nellie
saw
the
doctor
s
cook
is
the
doctor
at
home
his
honour
s
asleep
whispered
the
cook
into
her
sleeve
as
though
afraid
of
waking
her
master
he
s
only
just
got
home
from
his
fever
patients
and
gave
orders
he
was
not
to
be
waked
but
nellie
scarcely
heard
the
cook
thrusting
her
aside
she
rushed
headlong
into
the
doctor
s
house
running
through
some
dark
and
stuffy
rooms
upsetting
two
or
three
chairs
she
at
last
reached
the
doctor
s
bedroom
stepan
lukitch
was
lying
on
his
bed
dressed
but
without
his
coat
and
with
pouting
lips
was
breathing
into
his
open
hand
a
little
night
light
glimmered
faintly
beside
him
without
uttering
a
word
nellie
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
she
wept
bitterly
shaking
all
over
my
husband
is
ill
she
sobbed
out
stepan
lukitch
was
silent
he
slowly
sat
up
propped
his
head
on
his
hand
and
looked
at
his
visitor
with
fixed
sleepy
eyes
my
husband
is
ill
nellie
continued
restraining
her
sobs
for
mercy
s
sake
come
quickly
make
haste
make
haste
eh
growled
the
doctor
blowing
into
his
hand
come
come
this
very
minute
or
it
s
terrible
to
think
for
mercy
s
sake
and
pale
exhausted
nellie
gasping
and
swallowing
her
tears
began
describing
to
the
doctor
her
husband
s
illness
her
unutterable
terror
her
sufferings
would
have
touched
the
heart
of
a
stone
but
the
doctor
looked
at
her
blew
into
his
open
hand
and
not
a
movement
i
ll
come
to
morrow
he
muttered
that
s
impossible
cried
nellie
i
know
my
husband
has
typhus
at
once
this
very
minute
you
are
needed
i
er
have
only
just
come
in
muttered
the
doctor
for
the
last
three
days
i
ve
been
away
seeing
typhus
patients
and
i
m
exhausted
and
ill
myself
i
simply
can
t
absolutely
i
ve
caught
it
myself
there
and
the
doctor
thrust
before
her
eyes
a
clinical
thermometer
my
temperature
is
nearly
forty
i
absolutely
can
t
i
can
scarcely
sit
up
excuse

but
i
implore

nellie
moaned
in
despair
i
beseech
you

me
for
mercy
s
sake
make
a
great
effort
and
come
i
will
repay
you
doctor
oh
dear
why
i
have
told
you
already
ah
nellie
leapt
up
and
walked
nervously
up
and
down
the
bedroom
she
longed
to
explain
to
the
doctor
to
bring
him
to
reason
she
thought
if
only
he
knew
how
dear
her
husband
was
to
her
and
how
unhappy
she
was
he
would
forget
his
exhaustion
and
his
illness
but
how
could
she
be
eloquent
enough
go
to
the
zemstvo
doctor
she
heard
stepan
lukitch
s
voice
that
s
impossible
he
lives
more
than
twenty
miles
from
here
and
time
is
precious
and
the
horses
can
t
stand
it
it
is
thirty
miles
from
us
to
you
and
as
much
from
here
to
the
zemstvo
doctor
no
it
s
impossible
come
along
stepan
lukitch
i
ask
of
you
an
heroic
deed
come

that
heroic
deed
have
pity
on
us
it
s
beyond
everything
i
m
in
a
fever
my
head
s
in
a
whirl
and
she
won
t
understand
leave
me
alone
but
you
are
in
duty
bound
to
come
you
can
not
refuse
to
come
it
s
egoism
a
man
is
bound
to
sacrifice
his
life
for
his
neighbour
and
you
you
refuse
to
come
i
will
summon
you
before
the
court
nellie
felt
that
she
was
uttering
a
false
and
undeserved
insult
but
for
her
husband
s
sake
she
was
capable
of
forgetting
logic
tact
sympathy
for
others
in
reply
to
her
threats
the
doctor
greedily
gulped
a
glass
of
cold
water
nellie
fell
to
entreating
and
imploring
like
the
very
lowest
beggar
at
last
the
doctor
gave
way
he
slowly
got
up
puffing
and
panting
looking
for
his
coat
here
it
is
cried
nellie
helping
him
let
me
put
it
on
to
you
come
along
i
will
repay
you
all
my
life
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
but
what
agony
after
putting
on
his
coat
the
doctor
lay
down
again
nellie
got
him
up
and
dragged
him
to
the
hall
then
there
was
an
agonizing
to
do
over
his
goloshes
his
overcoat
his
cap
was
lost
but
at
last
nellie
was
in
the
carriage
with
the
doctor
now
they
had
only
to
drive
thirty
miles
and
her
husband
would
have
a
doctor
s
help
the
earth
was
wrapped
in
darkness
one
could
not
see
one
s
hand
before
one
s
face
a
cold
winter
wind
was
blowing
there
were
frozen
lumps
under
their
wheels
the
coachman
was
continually
stopping
and
wondering
which
road
to
take
nellie
and
the
doctor
sat
silent
all
the
way
it
was
fearfully
jolting
but
they
felt
neither
the
cold
nor
the
jolts
get
on
get
on
nellie
implored
the
driver
at
five
in
the
morning
the
exhausted
horses
drove
into
the
yard
nellie
saw
the
familiar
gates
the
well
with
the
crane
the
long
row
of
stables
and
barns
at
last
she
was
at
home
wait
a
moment
i
will
be
back
directly
she
said
to
stepan
lukitch
making
him
sit
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
dining
room
sit
still
and
wait
a
little
and
i
ll
see
how
he
is
going
on
on
her
return
from
her
husband
nellie
found
the
doctor
lying
down
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
and
muttering
doctor
please
doctor
eh
ask
domna
muttered
stepan
lukitch
what
they
said
at
the
meeting
vlassov
said
who
what
and
to
her
horror
nellie
saw
that
the
doctor
was
as
delirious
as
her
husband
what
was
to
be
done
i
must
go
for
the
zemstvo
doctor
she
decided
then
again
there
followed
darkness
a
cutting
cold
wind
lumps
of
frozen
earth
she
was
suffering
in
body
and
in
soul
and
delusive
nature
has
no
arts
no
deceptions
to
compensate
these
sufferings
then
she
saw
against
the
grey
background
how
her
husband
every
spring
was
in
straits
for
money
to
pay
the
interest
for
the
mortgage
to
the
bank
he
could
not
sleep
she
could
not
sleep
and
both
racked
their
brains
till
their
heads
ached
thinking
how
to
avoid
being
visited
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
she
saw
her
children
the
everlasting
apprehension
of
colds
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
bad
marks
at
school
separation
out
of
a
brood
of
five
or
six
one
was
sure
to
die
the
grey
background
was
not
untouched
by
death
that
might
well
be
a
husband
and
wife
can
not
die
simultaneously
whatever
happened
one
must
bury
the
other
and
nellie
saw
her
husband
dying
this
terrible
event
presented
itself
to
her
in
every
detail
she
saw
the
coffin
the
candles
the
deacon
and
even
the
footmarks
in
the
hall
made
by
the
undertaker
why
is
it
what
is
it
for
she
asked
looking
blankly
at
her
husband
s
face
and
all
the
previous
life
with
her
husband
seemed
to
her
a
stupid
prelude
to
this
something
fell
from
nellie
s
hand
and
knocked
on
the
floor
she
started
jumped
up
and
opened
her
eyes
wide
one
looking
glass
she
saw
lying
at
her
feet
the
other
was
standing
as
before
on
the
table
she
looked
into
the
looking
glass
and
saw
a
pale
tear
stained
face
there
was
no
grey
background
now
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
she
thought
with
a
sigh
of
relief
old
age
uzelkov
an
architect
with
the
rank
of
civil
councillor
arrived
in
his
native
town
to
which
he
had
been
invited
to
restore
the
church
in
the
cemetery
he
had
been
born
in
the
town
had
been
at
school
had
grown
up
and
married
in
it
but
when
he
got
out
of
the
train
he
scarcely
recognized
it
everything
was
changed
eighteen
years
ago
when
he
had
moved
to
petersburg
the
street
boys
used
to
catch
marmots
for
instance
on
the
spot
where
now
the
station
was
standing
now
when
one
drove
into
the
chief
street
a
hotel
of
four
storeys
stood
facing
one
in
old
days
there
was
an
ugly
grey
fence
just
there
but
nothing
neither
fences
nor
houses
had
changed
as
much
as
the
people
from
his
enquiries
of
the
hotel
waiter
uzelkov
learned
that
more
than
half
of
the
people
he
remembered
were
dead
reduced
to
poverty
forgotten
and
do
you
remember
uzelkov
he
asked
the
old
waiter
about
himself
uzelkov
the
architect
who
divorced
his
wife
he
used
to
have
a
house
in
svirebeyevsky
street
you
must
remember
i
don
t
remember
sir
how
is
it
you
don
t
remember
the
case
made
a
lot
of
noise
even
the
cabmen
all
knew
about
it
think
now
shapkin
the
attorney
managed
my
divorce
for
me
the
rascal
the
notorious
cardsharper
the
fellow
who
got
a
thrashing
at
the
club
ivan
nikolaitch
yes

he
alive

sir
thank
god
he
is
a
notary
now
and
has
an
office
he
is
very
well
off
he
has
two
houses
in
kirpitchny
street
his
daughter
was
married
the
other
day
uzelkov
paced
up
and
down
the
room
thought
a
bit
and
in
his
boredom
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
see
shapkin
at
his
office
when
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel
and
sauntered
slowly
towards
kirpitchny
street
it
was
midday
he
found
shapkin
at
his
office
and
scarcely
recognized
him
from
the
once
well
made
adroit
attorney
with
a
mobile
insolent
and
always
drunken
face
shapkin
had
changed
into
a
modest
grey
headed
decrepit
old
man
you
don
t
recognize
me
you
have
forgotten
me
began
uzelkov
i
am
your
old
client
uzelkov
uzelkov
what
uzelkov
ah
shapkin
remembered
recognized
and
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
there
followed
a
shower
of
exclamations
questions
recollections
this
is
a
surprise
this
is
unexpected
cackled
shapkin
what
can
i
offer
you
do
you
care
for
champagne
perhaps
you
would
like
oysters
my
dear
fellow
i
have
had
so
much
from
you
in
my
time
that
i
can
t
offer
you
anything
equal
to
the
occasion
please
don
t
put
yourself
out
said
uzelkov
i
have
no
time
to
spare
i
must
go
at
once
to
the
cemetery
and
examine
the
church
i
have
undertaken
the
restoration
of
it
that
s
capital
we
ll
have
a
snack
and
a
drink
and
drive
together
i
have
capital
horses
i
ll
take
you
there
and
introduce
you
to
the
church
warden
i
will
arrange
it
all
but
why
is
it
my
angel
you
seem
to
be
afraid
of
me
and
hold
me
at
arm
s
length
sit
a
little
nearer
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
be
afraid
of
me
nowadays
he
he
at
one
time
it
is
true
i
was
a
cunning
blade
a
dog
of
a
fellow
no
one
dared
approach
me
but
now
i
am
stiller
than
water
and
humbler
than
the
grass
i
have
grown
old
i
am
a
family
man
i
have
children
it
s
time
i
was
dead
the
friends
had
lunch
had
a
drink
and
with
a
pair
of
horses
drove
out
of
the
town
to
the
cemetery
yes
those
were
times
shapkin
recalled
as
he
sat
in
the
sledge
when
you
remember
them
you
simply
can
t
believe
in
them
do
you
remember
how
you
divorced
your
wife
it
s
nearly
twenty
years
ago
and
i
dare
say
you
have
forgotten
it
all
but
i
remember
it
as
though
i
d
divorced
you
yesterday
good
lord
what
a
lot
of
worry
i
had
over
it
i
was
a
sharp
fellow
tricky
and
cunning
a
desperate
character
sometimes
i
was
burning
to
tackle
some
ticklish
business
especially
if
the
fee
were
a
good
one
as
for
instance
in
your
case
what
did
you
pay
me
then
five
or
six
thousand
that
was
worth
taking
trouble
for
wasn
t
it
you
went
off
to
petersburg
and
left
the
whole
thing
in
my
hands
to
do
the
best
i
could
and
though
sofya
mihailovna
your
wife
came
only
of
a
merchant
family
she
was
proud
and
dignified
to
bribe
her
to
take
the
guilt
on
herself
was
difficult
awfully
difficult
i
would
go
to
negotiate
with
her
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
called
to
her
maid
masha
didn
t
i
tell
you
not
to
admit
that
scoundrel
well
i
tried
one
thing
and
another
i
wrote
her
letters
and
contrived
to
meet
her
accidentally
it
was
no
use
i
had
to
act
through
a
third
person
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
her
for
a
long
time
and
she
only
gave
in
when
you
agreed
to
give
her
ten
thousand
she
couldn
t
resist
ten
thousand
she
couldn
t
hold
out
she
cried
she
spat
in
my
face
but
she
consented
she
took
the
guilt
on
herself
i
thought
it
was
fifteen
thousand
she
had
from
me
not
ten
said
uzelkov
yes
yes
fifteen
i
made
a
mistake
said
shapkin
in
confusion
it
s
all
over
and
done
with
though
it
s
no
use
concealing
it
i
gave
her
ten
and
the
other
five
i
collared
for
myself
i
deceived
you
both
it
s
all
over
and
done
with
it
s
no
use
to
be
ashamed
and
indeed
judge
for
yourself
boris
petrovitch
weren
t
you
the
very
person
for
me
to
get
money
out
of
you
were
a
wealthy
man
and
had
everything
you
wanted
your
marriage
was
an
idle
whim
and
so
was
your
divorce
you
were
making
a
lot
of
money
i
remember
you
made
a
scoop
of
twenty
thousand
over
one
contract
whom
should
i
have
fleeced
if
not
you
and
i
must
own
i
envied
you
if
you
grabbed
anything
they
took
off
their
caps
to
you
while
they
would
thrash
me
for
a
rouble
and
slap
me
in
the
face
at
the
club
but
there
why
recall
it
it
is
high
time
to
forget
it
tell
me
please
how
did
sofya
mihailovna
get
on
afterwards
with
her
ten
thousand
very
badly
god
knows
what
it
was
she
lost
her
head
perhaps
or
maybe
her
pride
and
her
conscience
tormented
her
at
having
sold
her
honour
or
perhaps
she
loved
you
but
do
you
know
she
took
to
drink
as
soon
as
she
got
her
money
she
was
off
driving
about
with
officers
it
was
drunkenness
dissipation
debauchery
when
she
went
to
a
restaurant
with
officers
she
was
not
content
with
port
or
anything
light
she
must
have
strong
brandy
fiery
stuff
to
stupefy
her
yes
she
was
eccentric
i
had
a
lot
to
put
up
with
from
her
sometimes
she
would
take
offence
at
something
and
begin
being
hysterical
and
what
happened
afterwards
one
week
passed
and
then
another
i
was
sitting
at
home
writing
something
all
at
once
the
door
opened
and
she
walked
in
drunk
take
back
your
cursed
money
she
said
and
flung
a
roll
of
notes
in
my
face
so
she
could
not
keep
it
up
i
picked
up
the
notes
and
counted
them
it
was
five
hundred
short
of
the
ten
thousand
so
she
had
only
managed
to
get
through
five
hundred
where
did
you
put
the
money
it
s
all
ancient
history
there
s
no
reason
to
conceal
it
now
in
my
pocket
of
course
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
wait
a
bit
for
what
will
come
later
it
s
a
regular
novel
a
pathological
study
a
couple
of
months
later
i
was
going
home
one
night
in
a
nasty
drunken
condition
i
lighted
a
candle
and
lo
and
behold
sofya
mihailovna
was
sitting
on
my
sofa
and
she
was
drunk
too
and
in
a
frantic
state
as
wild
as
though
she
had
run
out
of
bedlam
give
me
back
my
money
she
said
i
have
changed
my
mind
if
i
must
go
to
ruin
i
won
t
do
it
by
halves
i
ll
have
my
fling
be
quick
you
scoundrel
give
me
my
money
a
disgraceful
scene
and
you
gave
it
her
i
gave
her
i
remember
ten
roubles
oh
how
could
you
cried
uzelkov
frowning
if
you
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
have
given
it
her
you
might
have
written
to
me
and
i
didn
t
know
i
didn
t
know
my
dear
fellow
what
use
would
it
have
been
for
me
to
write
considering
that
she
wrote
to
you
herself
when
she
was
lying
in
the
hospital
afterwards
yes
but
i
was
so
taken
up
then
with
my
second
marriage
i
was
in
such
a
whirl
that
i
had
no
thoughts
to
spare
for
letters
but
you
were
an
outsider
you
had
no
antipathy
for
sofya
why
didn
t
you
give
her
a
helping
hand
you
can
t
judge
by
the
standards
of
to
day
boris
petrovitch
that
s
how
we
look
at
it
now
but
at
the
time
we
thought
very
differently
now
maybe
i
d
give
her
a
thousand
roubles
but
then
even
that
ten
rouble
note
i
did
not
give
her
for
nothing
it
was
a
bad
business
we
must
forget
it
but
here
we
are
the
sledge
stopped
at
the
cemetery
gates
uzelkov
and
shapkin
got
out
of
the
sledge
went
in
at
the
gate
and
walked
up
a
long
broad
avenue
the
bare
cherry
trees
and
acacias
the
grey
crosses
and
tombstones
were
silvered
with
hoar
frost
every
little
grain
of
snow
reflected
the
bright
sunny
day
there
was
the
smell
there
always
is
in
cemeteries
the
smell
of
incense
and
freshly
dug
earth
our
cemetery
is
a
pretty
one
said
uzelkov
quite
a
garden
yes
but
it
is
a
pity
thieves
steal
the
tombstones
and
over
there
beyond
that
iron
monument
on
the
right
sofya
mihailovna
is
buried
would
you
like
to
see
the
friends
turned
to
the
right
and
walked
through
the
deep
snow
to
the
iron
monument
here
it
is
said
shapkin
pointing
to
a
little
slab
of
white
marble
a
lieutenant
put
the
stone
on
her
grave
uzelkov
slowly
took
off
his
cap
and
exposed
his
bald
head
to
the
sun
shapkin
looking
at
him
took
off
his
cap
too
and
another
bald
patch
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
there
was
the
stillness
of
the
tomb
all
around
as
though
the
air
too
were
dead
the
friends
looked
at
the
grave
pondered
and
said
nothing
she
sleeps
in
peace
said
shapkin
breaking
the
silence
it
s
nothing
to
her
now
that
she
took
the
blame
on
herself
and
drank
brandy
you
must
own
boris
petrovitch
own
what
uzelkov
asked
gloomily
why
however
hateful
the
past
it
was
better
than
this
and
shapkin
pointed
to
his
grey
head
i
used
not
to
think
of
the
hour
of
death
i
fancied
i
could
have
given
death
points
and
won
the
game
if
we
had
had
an
encounter
but
now
but
what
s
the
good
of
talking
uzelkov
was
overcome
with
melancholy
he
suddenly
had
a
passionate
longing
to
weep
as
once
he
had
longed
for
love
and
he
felt
those
tears
would
have
tasted
sweet
and
refreshing
a
moisture
came
into
his
eyes
and
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
but
shapkin
was
standing
beside
him
and
uzelkov
was
ashamed
to
show
weakness
before
a
witness
he
turned
back
abruptly
and
went
into
the
church
only
two
hours
later
after
talking
to
the
churchwarden
and
looking
over
the
church
he
seized
a
moment
when
shapkin
was
in
conversation
with
the
priest
and
hastened
away
to
weep
he
stole
up
to
the
grave
secretly
furtively
looking
round
him
every
minute
the
little
white
slab
looked
at
him
pensively
mournfully
and
innocently
as
though
a
little
girl
lay
under
it
instead
of
a
dissolute
divorced
wife
to
weep
to
weep
thought
uzelkov
but
the
moment
for
tears
had
been
missed
though
the
old
man
balinked
his
eyes
though
he
worked
up
his
feelings
the
tears
did
not
flow
nor
the
lump
come
in
his
throat
after
standing
for
ten
minutes
with
a
gesture
of
despair
uzelkov
went
to
look
for
shapkin
darkness
a
young
peasant
with
white
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
and
broad
cheekbones
in
a
torn
sheepskin
and
big
black
felt
overboots
waited
till
the
zemstvo
doctor
had
finished
seeing
his
patients
and
came
out
to
go
home
from
the
hospital
then
he
went
up
to
him
diffidently
please
your
honour
he
said
what
do
you
want
the
young
man
passed
the
palm
of
his
hand
up
and
over
his
nose
looked
at
the
sky
and
then
answered
please
your
honour
you
ve
got
my
brother
vaska
the
blacksmith
from

the

looked
wonderingly
at
kirila
and
without
saying
a
word
walked
on
the
young
peasant
ran
on
in
front
and
flung
himself
in
a
heap
at
his
feet

asked
the

angrily
how

let

go
why
he
is
a
convict
kirila
began
crying
let
him
go
tfoo
queer
fellow
what
right
have
i
am
i
a
gaoler
or
what
they
brought
him
to
the
hospital
for
me
to
treat
him
but
i
have
as
much
right
to
let
him
out
as
i
have
to
put
you
in
prison
silly
fellow
but
they
have
shut
him
up
for
nothing
he
was
in
prison
a
year
before
the
trial
and
now
there
is
no
saying
what
he
is
there
for
it
would
have
been
a
different
thing
if
he
had
murdered
someone
let
us
say
or
stolen
horses
but
as
it
is
what
is
it
all
about
very
likely
but
how
do
i
come
in
they
shut
a
man
up
and
they
don
t
know
themselves
what
for
he
was
drunk
your
honour
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
and
even
hit
father
on
the
ear
and
scratched
his
own
cheek
on
a
branch
and
two
of
our
fellows
they
wanted
some
turkish
tobacco
you
see
began
telling
him
to
go
with
them
and
break
into
the
armenian
s
shop
at
night
for
tobacco
being
drunk
he
obeyed
them
the
fool
they
broke
the
lock
you
know
got
in
and
did
no
end
of
mischief
they
turned
everything
upside
down
broke
the
windows
and
scattered
the
flour
about
they
were
drunk
that
is
all
one
can
say
well
the
constable
turned
up
and
with
one
thing
and
another
they
took
them
off
to
the
magistrate
they
have
been
a
whole
year
in
prison
and
a
week
ago
on
the
wednesday
they
were
all
three
tried
in
the
town
a
soldier
stood
behind
them
with
a
gun
people
were
sworn
in
vaska
was
less
to
blame
than
any
but
the
gentry
decided
that
he
was
the
ringleader
the
other
two
lads
were
sent
to
prison
but
vaska
to
a
convict
battalion
for
three
years
and
what
for
one
should
judge
like
a
christian
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
tell
you
again
go
to
the
authorities
i
have
been
already
i
ve
been
to
the
court
i
have
tried
to
send
in
a
petition
they
wouldn
t
take
a
petition
i
have
been
to
the
police
captain
and
i
have
been
to
the
examining
magistrate
and
everyone
says
it
is
not
my
business
whose
business
is
it
then
but
there
is
no
one
above
you
here
in
the
hospital
you
do
what
you
like
your
honour
you
simpleton
sighed
the
doctor
once
the
jury
have
found
him
guilty
not
the
governor
not
even
the
minister
could
do
anything
let
alone
the
police
captain
it
s
no
good
your
trying
to
do
anything
and
who
judged
him
then
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
they
weren
t
gentlemen
they
were
our
peasants
andrey
guryev
was
one
aloshka
huk
was
one
well
i
am
cold
talking
to
you
the
doctor
waved
his
hand
and
walked
quickly
to
his
own
door
kirila
was
on
the
point
of
following
him
but
seeing
the
door
slam
he
stopped
for
ten
minutes
he
stood
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
hospital
yard
and
without
putting
on
his
cap
stared
at
the
doctor
s
house
then
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
slowly
scratched
himself
and
walked
towards
the
gate
to
whom
am
i
to
go
he
muttered
as
he
came
out
on
to
the
road
one
says
it
is
not
his
business
another
says
it
is
not
his
business
whose
business
is
it
then
no
till
you
grease
their
hands
you
will
get
nothing
out
of
them
the
doctor
says
that
but
he
keeps
looking
all
the
while
at
my
fist
to
see
whether
i
am
going
to
give
him
a
blue
note
well
brother
i
ll
go
if
it
has
to
be
to
the
governor
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
continually
looking
round
him
in
an
objectless
way
he
trudged
lazily
along
the
road
and
was
apparently
wondering
where
to
go
it
was
not
cold
and
the
snow
faintly
crunched
under
his
feet
not
more
than
half
a
mile
in
front
of
him
the
wretched
little
district
town
in
which
his
brother
had
just
been
tried
lay
outstretched
on
the
hill
on
the
right
was
the
dark
prison
with
its
red
roof
and
sentry
boxes
at
the
corners
on
the
left
was
the
big
town
copse
now
covered
with
hoar
frost
it
was
still
only
an
old
man
wearing
a
woman
s
short
jacket
and
a
huge
cap
was
walking
ahead
coughing
and
shouting
to
a
cow
which
he
was
driving
to
the
town
good
day
grandfather
said
kirila
overtaking
him
good
day
are
you
driving
it
to
the
market
no
the
old
man
answered
lazily
are
you
a
townsman
they
got
into
conversation
kirila
told
him
what
he
had
come
to
the
hospital
for
and
what
he
had
been
talking
about
to
the
doctor
the
doctor
does
not
know
anything
about
such
matters
that
is
a
sure
thing
the
old
man
said
to
him
as
they
were
both
entering
the
town
though
he
is
a
gentleman
he
is
only
taught
to
cure
by
every
means
but
to
give
you
real
advice
or
let
us
say
write
out
a
petition
for
you
that
he
can
not
do
there
are
special
authorities
to
do
that
you
have
been
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
to
the
police
captain
they
are
no
good
for
your
business
either
where
am
i
to
go
the
permanent
member
of
the
rural
board
is
the
chief
person
for
peasants
affairs
go
to
him
mr
sineokov
the
one
who
is
at
zolotovo
why
yes
at
zolotovo
he
is
your
chief
man
if
it
is
anything
that
has
to
do
with
you
peasants
even
the
police
captain
has
no
authority
against
him
it
s
a
long
way
to
go
old
man
i
dare
say
it
s
twelve
miles
and
may
be
more
one
who
needs
something
will
go
seventy
that
is
so
should
i
send
in
a
petition
to
him
or
what
you
will
find
out
there
if
you
should
have
a
petition
the
clerk
will
write
you
one
quick
enough
the
permanent
member
has
a
clerk
after
parting
from
the
old
man
kirila
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
square
thought
a
little
and
walked
back
out
of
the
town
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
zolotovo
five
days
later
as
the
doctor
was
on
his
way
home
after
seeing
his
patients
he
caught
sight
of
kirila
again
in
his
yard
this
time
the
young
peasant
was
not
alone
but
with
a
gaunt
very
pale
old
man
who
nodded
his
head
without
ceasing
like
a
pendulum
and
mumbled
with
his
lips
your
honour
i
have
come
again
to
ask
your
gracious
mercy
began
kirila
here
i
have
come
with
my
father
be
merciful
let
vaska
go
the
permanent
member
would
not
talk
to
me
he
said
go
away
your
honour
the
old
man
hissed
in
his
throat
raising
his
twitching
eyebrows
be
merciful
we
are
poor
people
we
can
not
repay
your
honour
but
if
you
graciously
please
kiryushka
or
vaska
can
repay
you
in
work
let
them
work
we
will
pay
with
work
said
kirila
and
he
raised
his
hand
above
his
head
as
though
he
would
take
an
oath
let
him
go
they
are
starving
they
are
crying
day
and
night
your
honour
the
young
peasant
bent
a
rapid
glance
on
his
father
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
and
both
of
them
as
at
the
word
of
command
fell
at
the
doctor
s
feet
the
latter
waved
his
hand
in
despair
and
without
looking
round
walked
quickly
in
at
his
door
the
beggar
kind
sir
be
so
good
as
to
notice
a
poor
hungry
man
i
have
not
tasted
food
for
three
days
i
have
not
a
five
kopeck
piece
for
a
night
s
lodging
i
swear
by
god
for
five
years
i
was
a
village
schoolmaster
and
lost
my
post
through
the
intrigues
of
the
zemstvo
i
was
the
victim
of
false
witness
i
have
been
out
of
a
place
for
a
year
now
skvortsov
a
petersburg
lawyer
looked
at
the
speaker
s
tattered
dark
blue
overcoat
at
his
muddy
drunken
eyes
at
the
red
patches
on
his
cheeks
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
seen
the
man
before
and
now
i
am
offered
a
post
in
the
kaluga
province
the
beggar
continued
but
i
have
not
the
means
for
the
journey
there
graciously
help
me
i
am
ashamed
to
ask
but
i
am
compelled
by
circumstances
skvortsov
looked
at
his
goloshes
of
which
one
was
shallow
like
a
shoe
while
the
other
came
high
up
the
leg
like
a
boot
and
suddenly
remembered
listen
the
day
before
yesterday
i
met
you
in
sadovoy
street
he
said
and
then
you
told
me
not
that
you
were
a
village
schoolmaster
but
that
you
were
a
student
who
had
been
expelled
do
you
remember
n
o
no
that
can
not
be
so
the
beggar
muttered
in
confusion
i
am
a
village
schoolmaster
and
if
you
wish
it
i
can
show
you
documents
to
prove
it
that
s
enough
lies
you
called
yourself
a
student
and
even
told
me
what
you
were
expelled
for
do
you
remember
skvortsov
flushed
and
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
his
face
turned
away
from
the
ragged
figure
it
s
contemptible
sir
he
cried
angrily
it
s
a
swindle
i
ll
hand
you
over
to
the
police
damn
you
you
are
poor
and
hungry
but
that
does
not
give
you
the
right
to
lie
so
shamelessly
the
ragged
figure
took
hold
of
the
door
handle
and
like
a
bird
in
a
snare
looked
round
the
hall
desperately
i
i
am
not
lying
he
muttered
i
can
show
documents
who
can
believe
you
skvortsov
went
on
still
indignant
to
exploit
the
sympathy
of
the
public
for
village
schoolmasters
and
students
it
s
so
low
so
mean
so
dirty
it
s
revolting
skvortsov
flew
into
a
rage
and
gave
the
beggar
a
merciless
scolding
the
ragged
fellow
s
insolent
lying
aroused
his
disgust
and
aversion
was
an
offence
against
what
he
skvortsov
loved
and
prized
in
himself
kindliness
a
feeling
heart
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
by
his
lying
by
his
treacherous
assault
upon
compassion
the
individual
had
as
it
were
defiled
the
charity
which
he
liked
to
give
to
the
poor
with
no
misgivings
in
his
heart
the
beggar
at
first
defended
himself
protested
with
oaths
then
he
sank
into
silence
and
hung
his
head
overcome
with
shame
sir
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
i
really
was
lying
i
am
not
a
student
and
not
a
village
schoolmaster
all
that
s
mere
invention
i
used
to
be
in
the
russian
choir
and
i
was
turned
out
of
it
for
drunkenness
but
what
can
i
do
believe
me
in
god
s
name
i
can
t
get
on
without
lying
when
i
tell
the
truth
no
one
will
give
me
anything
with
the
truth
one
may
die
of
hunger
and
freeze
without
a
night
s
lodging
what
you
say
is
true
i
understand
that
but
what
am
i
to
do
what
are
you
to
do
you
ask
what
are
you
to
do
cried
skvortsov
going
close
up
to
him
work
that
s
what
you
must
do
you
must
work
work
i
know
that
myself
but
where
can
i
get
work
nonsense
you
are
young
strong
and
healthy
and
could
always
find
work
if
you
wanted
to
but
you
know
you
are
lazy
pampered
drunken
you
reek
of
vodka
like
a
pothouse
you
have
become
false
and
corrupt
to
the
marrow
of
your
bones
and
fit
for
nothing
but
begging
and
lying
if
you
do
graciously
condescend
to
take
work
you
must
have
a
job
in
an
office
in
the
russian
choir
or
as
a
billiard
marker
where
you
will
have
a
salary
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
how
would
you
like
to
undertake
manual
labour
i
ll
be
bound
you
wouldn
t
be
a
house
porter
or
a
factory
hand
you
are
too
genteel
for
that
what
things
you
say
really
said
the
beggar
and
he
gave
a
bitter
smile
how
can
i
get
manual
work
it
s
rather
late
for
me
to
be
a
shopman
for
in
trade
one
has
to
begin
from
a
boy
no
one
would
take
me
as
a
house
porter
because
i
am
not
of
that
class
and
i
could
not
get
work
in
a
factory
one
must
know
a
trade
and
i
know
nothing
nonsense
you
always
find
some
justification
wouldn
t
you
like
to
chop
wood
i
would
not
refuse
to
but
the
regular
woodchoppers
are
out
of
work
now
oh
all
idlers
argue
like
that
as
soon
as
you
are
offered
anything
you
refuse
it
would
you
care
to
chop
wood
for
me
certainly
i
will
very
good
we
shall
see
excellent
we
ll
see
skvortsov
in
nervous
haste
and
not
without
malignant
pleasure
rubbing
his
hands
summoned
his
cook
from
the
kitchen
here
olga
he
said
to
her
take
this
gentleman
to
the
shed
and
let
him
chop
some
wood
the
beggar
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
puzzled
and
irresolutely
followed
the
cook
it
was
evident
from
his
demeanour
that
he
had
consented
to
go
and
chop
wood
not
because
he
was
hungry
and
wanted
to
earn
money
but
simply
from
shame
and
amour
propre
because
he
had
been
taken
at
his
word
it
was
clear
too
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
vodka
that
he
was
unwell
and
felt
not
the
faintest
inclination
to
work
skvortsov
hurried
into
the
dining
room
there
from
the
window
which
looked
out
into
the
yard
he
could
see
the
woodshed
and
everything
that
happened
in
the
yard
standing
at
the
window
skvortsov
saw
the
cook
and
the
beggar
come
by
the
back
way
into
the
yard
and
go
through
the
muddy
snow
to
the
woodshed
olga
scrutinized
her
companion
angrily
and
jerking
her
elbow
unlocked
the
woodshed
and
angrily
banged
the
door
open
most
likely
we
interrupted
the
woman
drinking
her
coffee
thought
skvortsov
what
a
cross
creature
she
is
then
he
saw
the
pseudo
schoolmaster
and
pseudo
student
seat
himself
on
a
block
of
wood
and
leaning
his
red
cheeks
upon
his
fists
sink
into
thought
the
cook
flung
an
axe
at
his
feet
spat
angrily
on
the
ground
and
judging
by
the
expression
of
her
lips
began
abusing
him
the
beggar
drew
a
log
of
wood
towards
him
irresolutely
set
it
up
between
his
feet
and
diffidently
drew
the
axe
across
it
the
log
toppled
and
fell
over
the
beggar
drew
it
towards
him
breathed
on
his
frozen
hands
and
again
drew
the
axe
along
it
as
cautiously
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
its
hitting
his
golosh
or
chopping
off
his
fingers
the
log
fell
over
again
skvortsov
s
wrath
had
passed
off
by
now
he
felt
sore
and
ashamed
at
the
thought
that
he
had
forced
a
pampered
drunken
and
perhaps
sick
man
to
do
hard
rough
work
in
the
cold
never
mind
let
him
go
on
he
thought
going
from
the
dining
room
into
his
study
i
am
doing
it
for
his
good
an
hour
later
olga
appeared
and
announced
that
the
wood
had
been
chopped
up
here
give
him
half
a
rouble
said
skvortsov
if
he
likes
let
him
come
and
chop
wood
on
the
first
of
every
month
there
will
always
be
work
for
him
on
the
first
of
the
month
the
beggar
turned
up
and
again
earned
half
a
rouble
though
he
could
hardly
stand
from
that
time
forward
he
took
to
turning
up
frequently
and
work
was
always
found
for
him
sometimes
he
would
sweep
the
snow
into
heaps
or
clear
up
the
shed
at
another
he
used
to
beat
the
rugs
and
the
mattresses
he
always
received
thirty
to
forty
kopecks
for
his
work
and
on
one
occasion
an
old
pair
of
trousers
was
sent
out
to
him
when
he
moved
skvortsov
engaged
him
to
assist
in
packing
and
moving
the
furniture
on
this
occasion
the
beggar
was
sober
gloomy
and
silent
he
scarcely
touched
the
furniture
walked
with
hanging
head
behind
the
furniture
vans
and
did
not
even
try
to
appear
busy
he
merely
shivered
with
the
cold
and
was
overcome
with
confusion
when
the
men
with
the
vans
laughed
at
his
idleness
feebleness
and
ragged
coat
that
had
once
been
a
gentleman
s
after
the
removal
skvortsov
sent
for
him
well
i
see
my
words
have
had
an
effect
upon
you
he
said
giving
him
a
rouble
this
is
for
your
work
i
see
that
you
are
sober
and
not
disinclined
to
work
what
is
your
name
lushkov
i
can
offer
you
better
work
not
so
rough
lushkov

note
to

to
my
colleague
and
he
will

some
copying
to
do
work
don
t
drink
and
don
t
forget
what
i
said
to
you
good
bye
skvortsov
pleased
that
he
had
put
a
man
in
the
path
of
rectitude
patted
lushkov
genially
on
the
shoulder
and
even
shook
hands
with
him
at
parting
lushkov
took
the
letter
departed
and
from
that
time
forward
did
not
come
to
the
back
yard
for
work
two
years
passed
one
day
as
skvortsov
was
standing
at
the
ticket
office
of
a
theatre
paying
for
his
ticket
he
saw
beside
him
a
little
man
with
a
lambskin
collar
and
a
shabby
cat
s
skin
cap
the
man
timidly
asked
the
clerk
for
a
gallery
ticket
and
paid
for
it
with
kopecks
lushkov

asked
skvortsov
recognizing
in
the
little
man
his
former
woodchopper

all
right

way

godson

i
who

you
into
the
right
way

you

what
a
scolding
i
gave
you

you
almost
sank
through
the
floor
that
time
well
thank
you
my
dear
fellow
for
remembering
my
words
thank
you
too
said
lushkov
if
i
had
not
come
to
you
that
day
maybe
i
should
be
calling
myself
a
schoolmaster
or
a
student
still
yes
in
your
house
i
was
saved
and
climbed
out
of
the
pit
i
am
very
very
glad
thank
you
for
your
kind
words
and
deeds
what
you
said
that
day
was
excellent
i
am
grateful
to
you
and
to
your
cook
god
bless
that
kind
noble
hearted
woman
what
you
said
that
day
was
excellent
i
am
indebted
to
you
as
long
as
i
live
of
course
but
it
was
your
cook
olga
who
really
saved
me
how
was
that
why
it
was
like
this
i
used
to
come
to
you
to
chop
wood
and
she
would
begin
ah
you
drunkard
you
god
forsaken
man
and
yet
death
does
not
take
you
and
then
she
would
sit
opposite
me
lamenting
looking
into
my
face
and
wailing
you
unlucky
fellow
you
have
no
gladness
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
you
will
burn
in
hell
poor
drunkard
you
poor
sorrowful
creature
and
she
always
went
on
in
that
style
you
know
how
often
she
upset
herself
and
how
many
tears
she
shed
over
me
i
can
t
tell
you
but
what
affected
me
most
she
chopped
the
wood
for
me
do
you
know
sir
i
never
chopped
a
single
log
for
you
she
did
it
all
how
it
was
she
saved
me
how
it
was
i
changed
looking
at
her
and
gave
up
drinking
i
can
t
explain
i
only
know
that
what
she
said
and
the
noble
way
she
behaved
brought
about
a
change
in
my
soul
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
it
s
time
to
go
up
though
they
are
just
going
to
ring
the
bell
lushkov
bowed
and
went
off
to
the
gallery
a
story
without
a
title
in
the
fifth
century
just
as
now
the
sun
rose
every
morning
and
every
evening
retired
to
rest
in
the
morning
when
the
first
rays
kissed
the
dew
the
earth
revived
the
air
was
filled
with
the
sounds
of
rapture
and
hope
while
in
the
evening
the
same
earth
subsided
into
silence
and
plunged
into
gloomy
darkness
one
day
was
like
another
one
night
like
another
from
time
to
time
a
storm
cloud
raced
up
and
there
was
the
angry
rumble
of
thunder
or
a
negligent
star
fell
out
of
the
sky
or
a
pale
monk
ran
to
tell
the
brotherhood
that
not
far
from
the
monastery
he
had
seen
a
tiger
and
that
was
all
and
then
each
day
was
like
the
next
the
monks
worked
and
prayed
and
their
father
superior
played
on
the
organ
made
latin
verses
and
wrote
music
the
wonderful
old
man
possessed
an
extraordinary
gift
he
played
on
the
organ
with
such
art
that
even
the
oldest
monks
whose
hearing
had
grown
somewhat
dull
towards
the
end
of
their
lives
could
not
restrain
their
tears
when
the
sounds
of
the
organ
floated
from
his
cell
when
he
spoke
of
anything
even
of
the
most
ordinary
things
for
instance
of
the
trees
of
the
wild
beasts
or
of
the
sea
they
could
not
listen
to
him
without
a
smile
or
tears
and
it
seemed
that
the
same
chords
vibrated
in
his
soul
as
in
the
organ
if
he
were
moved
to
anger
or
abandoned
himself
to
intense
joy
or
began
speaking
of
something
terrible
or
grand
then
a
passionate
inspiration
took
possession
of
him
tears
came
into
his
flashing
eyes
his
face
flushed
and
his
voice
thundered
and
as
the
monks
listened
to
him
they
felt
that
their
souls
were
spell
bound
by
his
inspiration
at
such
marvellous
splendid
moments
his
power
over
them
was
boundless
and
if
he
had
bidden
his
elders
fling
themselves
into
the
sea
they
would
all
every
one
of
them
have
hastened
to
carry
out
his
wishes
his
music
his
voice
his
poetry
in
which
he
glorified
god
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
a
continual
source
of
joy
to
the
monks
it
sometimes
happened
that
through
the
monotony
of
their
lives
they
grew
weary
of
the
trees
the
flowers
the
spring
the
autumn
their
ears
were
tired
of
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
the
song
of
the
birds
seemed
tedious
to
them
but
the
talents
of
their
father
superior
were
as
necessary
to
them
as
their
daily
bread
dozens
of
years
passed
by
and
every
day
was
like
every
other
day
every
night
was
like
every
other
night
except
the
birds
and
the
wild
beasts
not
one
soul
appeared
near
the
monastery
the
nearest
human
habitation
was
far
away
and
to
reach
it
from
the
monastery
or
to
reach
the
monastery
from
it
meant
a
journey
of
over
seventy
miles
across
the
desert
only
men
who
despised
life
who
had
renounced
it
and
who
came
to
the
monastery
as
to
the
grave
ventured
to
cross
the
desert
what
was
the
amazement
of
the
monks
therefore
when
one
night
there
knocked
at
their
gate
a
man
who
turned
out
to
be
from
the
town
and
the
most
ordinary
sinner
who
loved
life
before
saying
his
prayers
and
asking
for
the
father
superior
s
blessing
this
man
asked
for
wine
and
food
to
the
question
how
he
had
come
from
the
town
into
the
desert
he
answered
by
a
long
story
of
hunting
he
had
gone
out
hunting
had
drunk
too
much
and
lost
his
way
to
the
suggestion
that
he
should
enter
the
monastery
and
save
his
soul
he
replied
with
a
smile
i
am
not
a
fit
companion
for
you
when
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
he
looked
at
the
monks
who
were
serving
him
shook
his
head
reproachfully
and
said
you
don
t
do
anything
you
monks
you
are
good
for
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking
is
that
the
way
to
save
one
s
soul
only
think
while
you
sit
here
in
peace
eat
and
drink
and
dream
of
beatitude
your
neighbours
are
perishing
and
going
to
hell
you
should
see
what
is
going
on
in
the
town
some
are
dying
of
hunger
others
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
their
gold
sink
into
profligacy
and
perish
like
flies
stuck
in
honey
there
is
no
faith
no
truth
in
men
whose
task
is
it
to
save
them
whose
work
is
it
to
preach
to
them
it
is
not
for
me
drunk
from
morning
till
night
as
i
am
can
a
meek
spirit
a
loving
heart
and
faith
in
god
have
been
given
you
for
you
to
sit
here
within
four
walls
doing
nothing
the
townsman
s
drunken
words
were
insolent
and
unseemly
but
they
had
a
strange
effect
upon
the
father
superior
the
old
man
exchanged
glances
with
his
monks
turned
pale
and
said
my
brothers
he
speaks
the
truth
you
know
indeed
poor
people
in
their
weakness
and
lack
of
understanding
are
perishing
in
vice
and
infidelity
while
we
do
not
move
as
though
it
did
not
concern
us
why
should
i
not
go
and
remind
them
of
the
christ
whom
they
have
forgotten
the
townsman
s
words
had
carried
the
old
man
away
the
next
day
he
took
his
staff
said
farewell
to
the
brotherhood
and
set
off
for
the
town
and
the
monks
were
left
without
music
and
without
his
speeches
and
verses
they
spent
a
month
drearily
then
a
second
but
the
old
man
did
not
come
back
at
last
after
three
months
had
passed
the
familiar
tap
of
his
staff
was
heard
the
monks
flew
to
meet
him
and
showered
questions
upon
him
but
instead
of
being
delighted
to
see
them
he
wept
bitterly
and
did
not
utter
a
word
the
monks
noticed
that
he
looked
greatly
aged
and
had
grown
thinner
his
face
looked
exhausted
and
wore
an
expression
of
profound
sadness
and
when
he
wept
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
been
outraged
the
monks
fell
to
weeping
too
and
began
with
sympathy
asking
him
why
he
was
weeping
why
his
face
was
so
gloomy
but
he
locked
himself
in
his
cell
without
uttering
a
word
for
seven
days
he
sat
in
his
cell
eating
and
drinking
nothing
weeping
and
not
playing
on
his
organ
to
knocking
at
his
door
and
to
the
entreaties
of
the
monks
to
come
out
and
share
his
grief
with
them
he
replied
with
unbroken
silence
at
last
he
came
out
gathering
all
the
monks
around
him
with
a
tear
stained
face
and
with
an
expression
of
grief
and
indignation
he
began
telling
them
of
what
had
befallen
him
during
those
three
months
his
voice
was
calm
and
his
eyes
were
smiling
while
he
described
his
journey
from
the
monastery
to
the
town
on
the
road
he
told
them
the
birds
sang
to
him
the
brooks
gurgled
and
sweet
youthful
hopes
agitated
his
soul
he
marched
on
and
felt
like
a
soldier
going
to
battle
and
confident
of
victory
he
walked
on
dreaming
and
composed
poems
and
hymns
and
reached
the
end
of
his
journey
without
noticing
it
but
his
voice
quivered
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
was
full
of
wrath
when
he
came
to
speak
of
the
town
and
of
the
men
in
it
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
or
even
dared
to
imagine
what
he
met
with
when
he
went
into
the
town
only
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
his
old
age
he
saw
and
understood
how
powerful
was
the
devil
how
fair
was
evil
and
how
weak
and
faint
hearted
and
worthless
were
men
by
an
unhappy
chance
the
first
dwelling
he
entered
was
the
abode
of
vice
some
fifty
men
in
possession
of
much
money
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
beyond
measure
intoxicated
by
the
wine
they
sang
songs
and
boldly
uttered
terrible
revolting
words
such
as
a
god
fearing
man
could
not
bring
himself
to
pronounce
boundlessly
free
self
confident
and
happy
they
feared
neither
god
nor
the
devil
nor
death
but
said
and
did
what
they
liked
and
went
whither
their
lust
led
them
and
the
wine
clear
as
amber
flecked
with
sparks
of
gold
must
have
been
irresistibly
sweet
and
fragrant
for
each
man
who
drank
it
smiled
blissfully
and
wanted
to
drink
more
to
the
smile
of
man
it
responded
with
a
smile
and
sparkled
joyfully
when
they
drank
it
as
though
it
knew
the
devilish
charm
it
kept
hidden
in
its
sweetness
the
old
man
growing
more
and
more
incensed
and
weeping
with
wrath
went
on
to
describe
what
he
had
seen
on
a
table
in
the
midst
of
the
revellers
he
said
stood
a
sinful
half
naked
woman
it
was
hard
to
imagine
or
to
find
in
nature
anything
more
lovely
and
fascinating
this
reptile
young
longhaired
dark
skinned
with
black
eyes
and
full
lips
shameless
and
insolent
showed
her
snow
white
teeth
and
smiled
as
though
to
say
look
how
shameless
how
beautiful
i
am
silk
and
brocade
fell
in
lovely
folds
from
her
shoulders
but
her
beauty
would
not
hide
itself
under
her
clothes
but
eagerly
thrust
itself
through
the
folds
like
the
young
grass
through
the
ground
in
spring
the
shameless
woman
drank
wine
sang
songs
and
abandoned
herself
to
anyone
who
wanted
her
then
the
old
man
wrathfully
brandishing
his
arms
described
the
horse
races
the
bull
fights
the
theatres
the
artists
studios
where
they
painted
naked
women
or
moulded
them
of
clay
he
spoke
with
inspiration
with
sonorous
beauty
as
though
he
were
playing
on
unseen
chords
while
the
monks
petrified
greedily
drank
in
his
words
and
gasped
with
rapture
after
describing
all
the
charms
of
the
devil
the
beauty
of
evil
and
the
fascinating
grace
of
the
dreadful
female
form
the
old
man
cursed
the
devil
turned
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
cell
when
he
came
out
of
his
cell
in
the
morning
there
was
not
a
monk
left
in
the
monastery
they
had
all
fled
to
the
town
in
trouble
pyotr
semyonitch
the
bank
manager
together
with
the
book
keeper
his
assistant
and
two
members
of
the
board
were
taken
in
the
night
to
prison
the
day
after
the
upheaval
the
merchant
avdeyev
who
was
one
of
the
committee
of
auditors
was
sitting
with
his
friends
in
the
shop
saying
so
it
is
god
s
will
it
seems
there
is
no
escaping
your
fate
here
to
day
we
are
eating
caviare
and
to
morrow
for
aught
we
know
it
will
be
prison
beggary
or
maybe
death
anything
may
happen
take
pyotr
semyonitch
for
instance
he
spoke
screwing
up
his
drunken
eyes
while
his
friends
went
on
drinking

caviare
and
listening
having
described
the
disgrace
and
helplessness
of
pyotr
semyonitch
who
only
the
day
before
had
been
powerful
and
respected
by
all
avdeyev
went
on
with
a
sigh
the
tears
of
the
mouse

back
to
the
cat

it
besides
i
can
t

without
my
spectacles
after
discussing
the
failure
of
the
bank
and
the
fate
of
pyotr
semyonitch
avdeyev
and
his
friends
went
to
eat
pie
at
the
house
of
a
friend
whose
wife
was
celebrating
her
name
day
at
the
name
day
party
everyone
was
discussing
the
bank
failure
avdeyev
was
more
excited
than
anyone
and
declared
that
he
had
long
foreseen
the
crash
and
knew
two
years
before
that
things
were
not
quite
right
at
the
bank
while
they
were
eating
pie
he
described
a
dozen
illegal
operations
which
had
come
to
his
knowledge
if
you
knew
why
did
you
not
give
information
asked
an
officer
who
was
present
i
wasn
t
the
only
one
the
whole
town
knew
of
it
laughed
avdeyev
besides
i
haven
t
the
time
to
hang
about
the
law
courts
damn
them
he
had
a
nap
after
the
pie
and
then
had
dinner
then
had
another
nap
then
went
to
the
evening
service
at
the
church
of
which
he
was
a
warden
after
the
service
he
went
back
to
the
name
day
party
and
played
preference
till
midnight
everything
seemed
satisfactory
but
when
avdeyev
hurried
home
after
midnight
the
cook
who
opened
the
door
to
him
looked
pale
and
was
trembling
so
violently
that
she
could
not
utter
a
word
his
wife
elizaveta
trofimovna
a
flabby
overfed
woman
with
her
grey
hair
hanging
loose
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
drawing
room
quivering
all
over
and
vacantly
rolling
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
drunk
her
elder
son
vassily
a
high
school
boy
pale
too
and
extremely
agitated
was
fussing
round
her
with
a
glass
of
water
what
s
the
matter
asked
avdeyev
and
looked
angrily
sideways
at
the
stove
his
family
was
constantly
being
upset
by
the
fumes
from
it
the
examining
magistrate
has
just
been
with
the
police
answered
vassily
they
ve
made
a
search
avdeyev
looked
round
him
the
cupboards
the
chests
the
tables
everything
bore
traces
of
the
recent
search
for
a
minute
avdeyev
stood
motionless
as
though
petrified
unable
to
understand
then
his
whole
inside
quivered
and
seemed
to
grow
heavy
his
left
leg
went
numb
and
unable
to
endure
his
trembling
he
lay
down
flat
on
the
sofa
he
felt
his
inside
heaving
and
his
rebellious
left
leg
tapping
against
the
back
of
the
sofa
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
minutes
he
recalled
the
whole
of
his
past
but
could
not
remember
any
crime
deserving
of
the
attention
of
the
police
it
s
all
nonsense
he
said
getting
up
they
must
have
slandered
me
to
morrow
i
must
lodge
a
complaint
of
their
having
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
next
morning
after
a
sleepless
night
avdeyev
as
usual
went
to
his
shop
his
customers
brought
him
the
news
that
during
the
night
the
public
prosecutor
had
sent
the
deputy
manager
and
the
head
clerk
to
prison
as
well
this
news
did
not
disturb
avdeyev
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
been
slandered
and
that
if
he
were
to
lodge
a
complaint
to
day
the
examining
magistrate
would
get
into
trouble
for
the
search
of
the
night
before
between
nine
and
ten
o
clock
he
hurried
to
the
town
hall
to
see
the
secretary
who
was
the
only
educated
man
in
the
town
council
vladimir
stepanitch
what
s
this
new
fashion
he
said
bending
down
to
the
secretary
s
ear
people
have
been
stealing
but
how
do
i
come
in
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
my
dear
fellow
he
whispered
there
has
been
a
search
at
my
house
last
night
upon
my
word
have
they
gone
crazy
why
touch
me
because
one
shouldn
t
be
a
sheep
the
secretary
answered
calmly
before
you
sign
you
ought
to
look
look
at
what
but
if
i
were
to
look
at
those
accounts
for
a
thousand
years
i
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
them
it
s
all
greek
to
me
i
am
no
book
keeper
they
used
to
bring
them
to
me
and
i
signed
them
excuse
me
apart
from
that
you
and
your
committee
are
seriously
compromised
you
borrowed
nineteen
thousand
from
the
bank
giving
no
security
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
cried
avdeyev
in
amazement
i
am
not
the
only
one
in
debt
to
the
bank
the
whole
town
owes
it
money
i
pay
the
interest
and
i
shall
repay
the
debt
what
next
and
besides
to
tell
the
honest
truth
it
wasn
t
i
myself
borrowed
the
money
pyotr
semyonitch
forced
it
upon
me
take
it
he
said
take
it
if
you
don
t
take
it
he
said
it
means
that
you
don
t
trust
us
and
fight
shy
of
us
you
take
it
he
said
and
build
your
father
a
mill
so
i
took
it
well
you
see
none
but
children
or
sheep
can
reason
like
that
in
any
case
signor
you
need
not
be
anxious
you
can
t
escape
trial
of
course
but
you
are
sure
to
be
acquitted
the
secretary
s
indifference
and
calm
tone
restored
avdeyev
s
composure
going
back
to
his
shop
and
finding
friends
there
he
again
began
drinking
eating
caviare
and
airing
his
views
he
almost
forgot
the
police
search
and
he
was
only
troubled
by
one
circumstance
which
he
could
not
help
noticing
his
left
leg
was
strangely
numb
and
his
stomach
for
some
reason
refused
to
do
its
work
that
evening
destiny
dealt
another
overwhelming
blow
at
avdeyev
at
an
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
town
council
all
members
who
were
on
the
staff
of
the
bank
avdeyev
among
them
were
asked
to
resign
on
the
ground
that
they
were
charged
with
a
criminal
offence
in
the
morning
he
received
a
request
to
give
up
immediately
his
duties
as
churchwarden
after
that
avdeyev
lost
count
of
the
blows
dealt
him
by
fate
and
strange
unprecedented
days
flitted
rapidly
by
one
after
another
and
every
day
brought
some
new
unexpected
surprise
among
other
things
the
examining
magistrate
sent
him
a
summons
and
he
returned
home
after
the
interview
insulted
and
red
in
the
face
he
gave
me
no
peace
pestering
me
to
tell
him
why
i
had
signed
i
signed
that
s
all
about
it
i
didn
t
do
it
on
purpose
they
brought
the
papers
to
the
shop
and
i
signed
them
i
am
no
great
hand
at
reading
writing
young
men
with
unconcerned
faces
arrived
sealed
up
the
shop
and
made
an
inventory
of
all
the
furniture
of
the
house
suspecting
some
intrigue
behind
this
and
as
before
unconscious
of
any
wrongdoing
avdeyev
in
his
mortification
ran
from
one
government
office
to
another
lodging
complaints
he
spent
hours
together
in
waiting
rooms
composed
long
petitions
shed
tears
swore
to
his
complaints
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
examining
magistrate
made
the
indifferent
and
rational
reply
come
to
us
when
you
are
summoned
we
have
not
time
to
attend
to
you
now
while
others
answered
it
is
not
our
business
the
secretary
an
educated
man
who
avdeyev
thought
might
have
helped
him
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
it
s
your
own
fault
you
shouldn
t
have
been
a
sheep
the
old
man
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
but
his
left
leg
was
still
numb
and
his
digestion
was
getting
worse
and
worse
when
he
was
weary
of
doing
nothing
and
was
getting
poorer
and
poorer
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
his
father
s
mill
or
to
his
brother
and
begin
dealing
in
corn
his
family
went
to
his
father
s
and
he
was
left
alone
the
days
flitted
by
one
after
another
without
a
family
without
a
shop
and
without
money
the
former
churchwarden
an
honoured
and
respected
man
spent
whole
days
going
the
round
of
his
friends
shops
drinking
eating
and
listening
to
advice
in
the
mornings
and
in
the
evenings
to
while
away
the
time
he
went
to
church
looking
for
hours
together
at
the
ikons
he
did
not
pray
but
pondered
his
conscience
was
clear
and
he
ascribed
his
position
to
mistake
and
misunderstanding
to
his
mind
it
was
all
due
to
the
fact
that
the
officials
and
the
examining
magistrates
were
young
men
and
inexperienced
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
were
to
talk
it
over
in
detail
and
open
his
heart
to
some
elderly
judge
everything
would
go
right
again
he
did
not
understand
his
judges
and
he
fancied
they
did
not
understand
him
the
days
raced
by
and
at
last
after
protracted
harassing
delays
the
day
of
the
trial
came
avdeyev
borrowed
fifty
roubles
and
providing
himself
with
spirit
to
rub
on
his
leg
and
a
decoction
of
herbs
for
his
digestion
set
off
for
the
town
where
the
circuit
court
was
being
held
the
trial
lasted
for
ten
days
throughout
the
trial
avdeyev
sat
among
his
companions
in
misfortune
with
the
stolid
composure
and
dignity
befitting
a
respectable
and
innocent
man
who
is
suffering
for
no
fault
of
his
own
he
listened
and
did
not
understand
a
word
he
was
in
an
antagonistic
mood
he
was
angry
at
being
detained
so
long
in
the
court
at
being
unable
to
get
lenten
food
anywhere
at
his
defending
counsel
s
not
understanding
him
and
as
he
thought
saying
the
wrong
thing
he
thought
that
the
judges
did
not
understand
their
business
they
took
scarcely
any
notice
of
avdeyev
they
only
addressed
him
once
in
three
days
and
the
questions
they
put
to
him
were
of
such
a
character
that
avdeyev
raised
a
laugh
in
the
audience
each
time
he
answered
them
when
he
tried
to
speak
of
the
expenses
he
had
incurred
of
his
losses
and
of
his
meaning
to
claim
his
costs
from
the
court
his
counsel
turned
round
and
made
an
incomprehensible
grimace
the
public
laughed
and
the
judge
announced
sternly
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
the
last
words
that
he
was
allowed
to
say
were
not
what
his
counsel
had
instructed
him
to
say
but
something
quite
different
which
raised
a
laugh
again
during
the
terrible
hour
when
the
jury
were
consulting
in
their
room
he
sat
angrily
in
the
refreshment
bar
not
thinking
about
the
jury
at
all
he
did
not
understand
why
they
were
so
long
deliberating
when
everything
was
so
clear
and
what
they
wanted
of
him
getting
hungry
he
asked
the
waiter
to
give
him
some
cheap
lenten
dish
for
forty
kopecks
they
gave
him
some
cold
fish
and
carrots
he
ate
it
and
felt
at
once
as
though
the
fish
were
heaving
in
a
chilly
lump
in
his
stomach
it
was
followed
by
flatulence
heartburn
and
pain
afterwards
as
he
listened
to
the
foreman
of
the
jury
reading
out
the
questions
point
by
point
there
was
a
regular
revolution
taking
place
in
his
inside
his
whole
body
was
bathed
in
a
cold
sweat
his
left
leg
was
numb
he
did
not
follow
understood
nothing
and
suffered
unbearably
at
not
being
able
to
sit
or
lie
down
while
the
foreman
was
reading
at
last
when
he
and
his
companions
were
allowed
to
sit
down
the
public
prosecutor
got
up
and
said
something
unintelligible
and
all
at
once
as
though
they
had
sprung
out
of
the
earth
some
police
officers
appeared
on
the
scene
with
drawn
swords
and
surrounded
all
the
prisoners
avdeyev
was
told
to
get
up
and
go
now
he
understood
that
he
was
found
guilty
and
in
charge
of
the
police
but
he
was
not
frightened
nor
amazed
such
a
turmoil
was
going
on
in
his
stomach
that
he
could
not
think
about
his
guards
so
they
won
t
let
us
go
back
to
the
hotel
he
asked
one
of
his
companions
but
i
have
three
roubles
and
an
untouched
quarter
of
a
pound
of
tea
in
my
room
there
he
spent
the
night
at
the
police
station
all
night
he
was
aware
of
a
loathing
for
fish
and
was
thinking
about
the
three
roubles
and
the
quarter
of
a
pound
of
tea
early
in
the
morning
when
the
sky
was
beginning
to
turn
blue
he
was
told
to
dress
and
set
off
two
soldiers
with
bayonets
took
him
to
prison
never
before
had
the
streets
of
the
town
seemed
to
him
so
long
and
endless
he
walked
not
on
the
pavement
but
in
the
middle
of
the
road
in
the
muddy
thawing
snow
his
inside
was
still
at
war
with
the
fish
his
left
leg
was
numb
he
had
forgotten
his
goloshes
either
in
the
court
or
in
the
police
station
and
his
feet
felt
frozen
five
days
later
all
the
prisoners
were
brought
before
the
court
again
to
hear
their
sentence
avdeyev
learnt
that
he
was
sentenced
to
exile
in
the
province
of
tobolsk
and
that
did
not
frighten
nor
amaze
him
either
he
fancied
for
some
reason
that
the
trial
was
not
yet
over
that
there
were
more
adjournments
to
come
and
that
the
final
decision
had
not
been
reached
yet
he
went
on
in
the
prison
expecting
this
final
decision
every
day
only
six
months
later
when
his
wife
and
his
son
vassily
came
to
say
good
bye
to
him
and
when
in
the
wasted
wretchedly
dressed
old
woman
he
scarcely
recognized
his
once
fat
and
dignified
elizaveta
trofimovna
and
when
he
saw
his
son
wearing
a
short
shabby
reefer
jacket
and
cotton
trousers
instead
of
the
high
school
uniform
he
realized
that
his
fate
was
decided
and
that
whatever
new
decision
there
might
be
his
past
would
never
come
back
to
him
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
trial
and
his
imprisonment
the
angry
expression
left
his
face
and
he
wept
bitterly
frost
a
popular
f
te
with
a
philanthropic
object
had
been
arranged
on
the
feast
of
epiphany
in
the
provincial
town
of
n
they
had
selected
a
broad
part
of
the
river
between
the
market
and
the
bishop
s
palace
fenced
it
round
with
a
rope
with
fir
trees
and
with
flags
and
provided
everything
necessary
for
skating
sledging
and
tobogganing
the
festivity
was
organized
on
the
grandest
scale
possible
the
notices
that
were
distributed
were
of
huge
size
and
promised
a
number
of
delights
skating
a
military
band
a
lottery
with
no
blank
tickets
an
electric
sun
and
so
on
but
the
whole
scheme
almost
came
to
nothing
owing
to
the
hard
frost
from
the
eve
of
epiphany
there
were
twenty
eight
degrees
of
frost
with
a
strong
wind
it
was
proposed
to
put
off
the
f
te
and
this
was
not
done
only
because
the
public
which
for
a
long
while
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
f
te
impatiently
would
not
consent
to
any
postponement
only
think
what
do
you
expect
in
winter
but
a
frost
said
the
ladies
persuading
the
governor
who
tried
to
insist
that
the
f
te
should
be
postponed
if
anyone
is
cold
he
can
go
and
warm
himself
the
trees
the
horses
the
men
s
beards
were
white
with
frost
it
even
seemed
that
the
air
itself
crackled
as
though
unable
to
endure
the
cold
but
in
spite
of
that
the
frozen
public
were
skating
immediately
after
the
blessing
of
the
waters
and
precisely
at
one
o
clock
the
military
band
began
playing
between
three
and
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
the
festivity
was
at
its
height
the
select
society
of
the
place
gathered
together
to
warm
themselves
in
the
governor
s
pavilion
which
had
been
put
up
on
the
river
bank
the
old
governor
and
his
wife
the
bishop
the
president
of
the
local
court
the
head
master
of
the
high
school
and
many
others
were
there
the
ladies
were
sitting
in
armchairs
while
the
men
crowded
round
the
wide
glass
door
looking
at
the
skating
holy
saints
said
the
bishop
in
surprise
what
flourishes
they
execute
with
their
legs
upon
my
soul
many
a
singer
couldn
t
do
a
twirl
with
his
voice
as
those
cut
throats
do
with
their
legs
aie
he
ll
kill
himself
that
s
smirnov
that
s
gruzdev
said
the
head
master
mentioning
the
names
of
the
schoolboys
who
flew
by
the
pavilion
bah
he
s
all
alive
oh
laughed
the
governor
look
gentlemen
our
mayor
is
coming
he
is
coming
this
way
that
s
a
nuisance
he
will
talk
our
heads
off
now
a
little
thin
old
man
wearing
a
big
cap
and
a
fur
lined
coat
hanging
open
came
from
the
opposite
bank
towards
the
pavilion
avoiding
the
skaters
this
was
the
mayor
of
the
town
a
merchant
eremeyev
by
name
a
millionaire
and
an
old
inhabitant
of
n
flinging
wide
his
arms
and
shrugging
at
the
cold
he
skipped
along
knocking
one
golosh
against
the
other
evidently
in
haste
to
get
out
of
the
wind
half
way
he
suddenly
bent
down
stole
up
to
some
lady
and
plucked
at
her
sleeve
from
behind
when
she
looked
round
he
skipped
away
and
probably
delighted
at
having
succeeded
in
frightening
her
went
off
into
a
loud
aged
laugh
lively
old
fellow
said
the
governor
it
s
a
wonder
he
s
not
skating
as
he
got
near
the
pavilion
the
mayor
fell
into
a
little
tripping
trot
waved
his
hands
and
taking
a
run
slid
along
the
ice
in
his
huge
golosh
boots
up
to
the
very
door
yegor
ivanitch
you
ought
to
get
yourself
some
skates
the
governor
greeted
him
that
s
just
what
i
am
thinking
he
answered
in
a
squeaky
somewhat
nasal
tenor
taking
off
his
cap
i
wish
you
good
health
your
excellency
your
holiness
long
life
to
all
the
other
gentlemen
and
ladies
here
s
a
frost
yes
it
is
a
frost
bother
it
it
s
deadly
winking
with
his
red
frozen
eyes
yegor
ivanitch
stamped
on
the
floor
with
his
golosh
boots
and
swung
his
arms
together
like
a
frozen
cabman
such
a
damnable
frost
worse
than
any
dog
he
went
on
talking
smiling
all
over
his
face
it
s
a
real
affliction
it
s
healthy
said
the
governor
frost
strengthens
a
man
and
makes
him
vigorous
though
it
may
be
healthy
it
would
be
better
without
it
at
all
said
the
mayor
wiping
his
wedge
shaped
beard
with
a
red
handkerchief
it
would
be
a
good
riddance
to
my
thinking
your
excellency
the
lord
sends
it
us
as
a
punishment
the
frost
i
mean
we
sin
in
the
summer
and
are
punished
in
the
winter
yes
yegor
ivanitch
looked
round
him
quickly
and
flung
up
his
hands
why
where
s
the
needful
to
warm
us
up
he
asked
looking
in
alarm
first
at
the
governor
and
then
at
the
bishop
your
excellency
your
holiness
i
ll
be
bound
the
ladies
are
frozen
too
we
must
have
something
this
won
t
do
everyone
began
gesticulating
and
declaring
that
they
had
not
come
to
the
skating
to
warm
themselves
but
the
mayor
heeding
no
one
opened
the
door
and
beckoned
to
someone
with
his
crooked
finger
a
workman
and
a
fireman
ran
up
to
him
here
run
off
to
savatin
he
muttered
and
tell
him
to
make
haste
and
send
here
what
do
you
call
it
what
s
it
to
be
tell
him
to
send
a
dozen
glasses
a
dozen
glasses
of
mulled
wine
the
very
hottest
or
punch
perhaps
there
was
laughter
in
the
pavilion
a
nice
thing
to
treat
us
to
never
mind
we
will
drink
it
muttered
the
mayor
a
dozen
glasses
then
and
some
benedictine
perhaps
and
tell
them
to
warm
two
bottles
of
red
wine
oh
and
what
for
the
ladies
well
you
tell
them
to
bring
cakes
nuts
sweets
of
some
sort
perhaps
there
run
along
look
sharp
the
mayor
was
silent
for
a
minute
and
then
began
again
abusing
the
frost
banging
his
arms
across
his
chest
and
thumping
with
his
golosh
boots
no
yegor
ivanitch
said
the
governor
persuasively
don
t
be
unfair
the
russian
frost
has
its
charms
i
was
reading
lately
that
many
of
the
good
qualities
of
the
russian
people
are
due
to
the
vast
expanse
of
their
land
and
to
the
climate
the
cruel
struggle
for
existence
that
s
perfectly
true
it
may
be
true
your
excellency
but
it
would
be
better
without
it
the
frost
did
drive
out
the
french
of
course
and
one
can
freeze
all
sorts
of
dishes
and
the
children
can
go
skating
that
s
all
true
for
the
man
who
is
well
fed
and
well
clothed
the
frost
is
only
a
pleasure
but
for
the
working
man
the
beggar
the
pilgrim
the
crazy
wanderer
it
s
the
greatest
evil
and
misfortune
it
s
misery
your
holiness
in
a
frost
like
this
poverty
is
twice
as
hard
and
the
thief
is
more
cunning
and
evildoers
more
violent
there
s
no
gainsaying
it
i
am
turned
seventy
i
ve
a
fur
coat
now
and
at
home
i
have
a
stove
and
rums
and
punches
of
all
sorts
the
frost
means
nothing
to
me
now
i
take
no
notice
of
it
i
don
t
care
to
know
of
it
but
how
it
used
to
be
in
old
days
holy
mother
it
s
dreadful
to
recall
it
my
memory
is
failing
me
with
years
and
i
have
forgotten
everything
my
enemies
and
my
sins
and
troubles
of
all
sorts
i
forget
them
all
but
the
frost
ough
how
i
remember
it
when
my
mother
died
i
was
left
a
little
devil
this
high
a
homeless
orphan
no
kith
nor
kin
wretched
ragged
little
clothes
hungry
nowhere
to
sleep
in
fact
we
have
here
no
abiding
city
but
seek
the
one
to
come
in
those
days
i
used
to
lead
an
old
blind
woman
about
the
town
for
five
kopecks
a
day
the
frosts
were
cruel
wicked
one
would
go
out
with
the
old
woman
and
begin
suffering
torments
my
creator
first
of
all
you
would
be
shivering
as
in
a
fever
shrugging
and
dancing
about
then
your
ears
your
fingers
your
feet
would
begin
aching
they
would
ache
as
though
someone
were
squeezing
them
with
pincers
but
all
that
would
have
been
nothing
a
trivial
matter
of
no
great
consequence
the
trouble
was
when
your
whole
body
was
chilled
one
would
walk
for
three
blessed
hours
in
the
frost
your
holiness
and
lose
all
human
semblance
your
legs
are
drawn
up
there
is
a
weight
on
your
chest
your
stomach
is
pinched
above
all
there
is
a
pain
in
your
heart
that
is
worse
than
anything
your
heart
aches
beyond
all
endurance
and
there
is
a
wretchedness
all
over
your
body
as
though
you
were
leading
death
by
the
hand
instead
of
an
old
woman
you
are
numb
all
over
turned
to
stone
like
a
statue
you
go
on
and
feel
as
though
it
were
not
you
walking
but
someone
else
moving
your
legs
instead
of
you
when
your
soul
is
frozen
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
doing
you
are
ready
to
leave
the
old
woman
with
no
one
to
guide
her
or
to
pull
a
hot
roll
from
off
a
hawker
s
tray
or
to
fight
with
someone
and
when
you
come
to
your
night
s
lodging
into
the
warmth
after
the
frost
there
is
not
much
joy
in
that
either
you
lie
awake
till
midnight
crying
and
don
t
know
yourself
what
you
are
crying
for
we
must
walk
about
the
skating
ground
before
it
gets
dark
said
the
governor
s
wife
who
was
bored
with
listening
who
s
coming
with
me
the
governor
s
wife
went
out
and
the
whole
company
trooped
out
of
the
pavilion
after
her
only
the
governor
the
bishop
and
the
mayor
remained
queen
of
heaven
and
what
i
went
through
when
i
was
a
shopboy
in
a
fish
shop
yegor
ivanitch
went
on
flinging
up
his
arms
so
that
his
fox
lined
coat
fell
open
one
would
go
out
to
the
shop
almost
before
it
was
light
by
eight
o
clock
i
was
completely
frozen
my
face
was
blue
my
fingers
were
stiff
so
that
i
could
not
fasten
my
buttons
nor
count
the
money
one
would
stand
in
the
cold
turn
numb
and
think
lord
i
shall
have
to
stand
like
this
right
on
till
evening
by
dinner
time
my
stomach
was
pinched
and
my
heart
was
aching
yes
and
i
was
not
much
better
afterwards
when
i
had
a
shop
of
my
own
the
frost
was
intense
and
the
shop
was
like
a
mouse
trap
with
draughts
blowing
in
all
directions
the
coat
i
had
on
was
pardon
me
mangy
as
thin
as
paper
threadbare
one
would
be
chilled
through
and
through
half
dazed
and
turn
as
cruel
as
the
frost
oneself
i
would
pull
one
by
the
ear
so
that
i
nearly
pulled
the
ear
off
i
would
smack
another
on
the
back
of
the
head
i
d
glare
at
a
customer
like
a
ruffian
a
wild
beast
and
be
ready
to
fleece
him
and
when
i
got
home
in
the
evening
and
ought
to
have
gone
to
bed
i
d
be
ill
humoured
and
set
upon
my
family
throwing
it
in
their
teeth
that
they
were
living
upon
me
i
would
make
a
row
and
carry
on
so
that
half
a
dozen
policemen
couldn
t
have
managed
me
the
frost
makes
one
spiteful
and
drives
one
to
drink
yegor
ivanitch
clasped
his
hands
and
went
on
and
when
we
were
taking
fish
to
moscow
in
the
winter
holy
mother
and
spluttering
as
he
talked
he
began
describing
the
horrors
he
endured
with
his
shopmen
when
he
was
taking
fish
to
moscow
yes
sighed
the
governor
it
is
wonderful
what
a
man
can
endure
you
used
to
take
wagon
loads
of
fish
to
moscow
yegor
ivanitch
while
i
in
my
time
was
at
the
war
i
remember
one
extraordinary
instance
and
the
governor
described
how
during
the
last
russo
turkish
war
one
frosty
night
the
division
in
which
he
was
had
stood
in
the
snow
without
moving
for
thirteen
hours
in
a
piercing
wind
from
fear
of
being
observed
the
division
did
not
light
a
fire
nor
make
a
sound
or
a
movement
they
were
forbidden
to
smoke
reminiscences
followed
the
governor
and
the
mayor
grew
lively
and
good
humoured
and
interrupting
each
other
began
recalling
their
experiences
and
the
bishop
told
them
how
when
he
was
serving
in
siberia
he
had
travelled
in
a
sledge
drawn
by
dogs
how
one
day
being
drowsy
in
a
time
of
sharp
frost
he
had
fallen
out
of
the
sledge
and
been
nearly
frozen
when
the
tunguses
turned
back
and
found
him
he
was
barely
alive
then
as
by
common
agreement
the
old
men
suddenly
sank
into
silence
sat
side
by
side
and
mused
ech
whispered
the
mayor
you
d
think
it
would
be
time
to
forget
but
when
you
look
at
the
water
carriers
at
the
schoolboys
at
the
convicts
in
their
wretched
gowns
it
brings
it
all
back
why
only
take
those
musicians
who
are
playing
now
i
ll
be
bound
there
is
a
pain
in
their
hearts
a
pinch
at
their
stomachs
and
their
trumpets
are
freezing
to
their
lips
they
play
and
think
holy
mother
we
have
another
three
hours
to
sit
here
in
the
cold
the
old
men
sank
into
thought
they
thought
of
that
in
man
which
is
higher
than
good
birth
higher
than
rank
and
wealth
and
learning
of
that
which
brings
the
lowest
beggar
near
to
god
of
the
helplessness
of
man
of
his
sufferings
and
his
patience
meanwhile
the
air
was
turning
blue
the
door
opened
and
two
waiters
from
savatin
s
walked
in
carrying
trays
and
a
big
muffled
teapot
when
the
glasses
had
been
filled
and
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
cinnamon
and
clove
in
the
air
the
door
opened
again
and
there
came
into
the
pavilion
a
beardless
young
policeman
whose
nose
was
crimson
and
who
was
covered
all
over
with
frost
he
went
up
to
the
governor
and
saluting
said
her
excellency
told
me
to
inform
you
that
she
has
gone
home
looking
at
the
way
the
policeman
put
his
stiff
frozen
fingers
to
his
cap
looking
at
his
nose
his
lustreless
eyes
and
his
hood
covered
with
white
frost
near
the
mouth
they
all
for
some
reason
felt
that
this
policeman
s
heart
must
be
aching
that
his
stomach
must
feel
pinched
and
his
soul
numb
i
say
said
the
governor
hesitatingly
have
a
drink
of
mulled
wine
it
s
all
right
it
s
all
right
drink
it
up
the
mayor
urged
him
gesticulating
don
t
be
shy
the
policeman
took
the
glass
in
both
hands
moved
aside
and
trying
to
drink
without
making
any
sound
began
discreetly
sipping
from
the
glass
he
drank
and
was
overwhelmed
with
embarrassment
while
the
old
men
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
they
all
fancied
that
the
pain
was
leaving
the
young
policeman
s
heart
and
that
his
soul
was
thawing
the
governor
heaved
a
sigh
it
s
time
we
were
at
home
he
said
getting
up
good
bye
i
say
he
added
addressing
the
policeman
tell
the
musicians
there
to
leave
off
playing
and
ask
pavel
semyonovitch
from
me
to
see
they
are
given
beer
or
vodka
the
governor
and
the
bishop
said
good
bye
to
the
mayor
and
went
out
of
the
pavilion
yegor
ivanitch
attacked
the
mulled
wine
and
before
the
policeman
had
finished
his
glass
succeeded
in
telling
him
a
great
many
interesting
things
he
could
not
be
silent
a
slander

successfully

hired
from

flitting
distractedly
about
the
rooms
dressed
in

tails
and
dirty
white
ties
there
was
a
continual
hubbub
and
din
of
conversation

the

the
french

talking
hurriedly
and
interrupting
one
another
as
they
described
to
the
guests
cases
of
persons
being
buried
alive
and
gave
their
opinions
on
spiritualism
none
of
them
believed
in
spiritualism

admitted

were
many
things
in
this
world

would
always
be
beyond

visitors

cases
in
which
a

the
right
to

on

subjects
as
you

were
alarming
but
very
agreeable
persons

precluded
them
from
entering

looking
in
at
the
windows
from
the

just
at
midnight
the

of

went
into
the
kitchen
to
see
whether
everything
was
ready
for

the
sturgeon
marfa
went
up
to
one
of
the
benches
and
cautiously
lifted
a
piece
of
greasy
newspaper
under
the
paper
on
an
immense
dish
there
reposed
a
huge
sturgeon
masked
in
jelly
and
decorated
with
capers
olives
and
carrots
ahineev
gazed
at
the
sturgeon
and
gasped
his
face
beamed
he
turned
his
eyes
up
he
bent
down
and
with
his
lips
emitted
the
sound
of
an
ungreased
wheel
after
standing
a
moment
he
snapped
his
fingers
with
delight
and
once
more
smacked
his
lips
ah
ah
the
sound
of
a
passionate
kiss
who
is
it
you
re
kissing
out
there
little
marfa
came
a
voice
from
the
next
room
and
in
the
doorway
there
appeared
the
cropped
head
of
the
assistant
usher
vankin
who
is
it
a
a
h
delighted
to
meet

ahineev
in
confusion
who

smacked
my
lips
in
reference
to
as
an
indication
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
fish
tell
that
to
the
marines
the
intrusive
face
vanished
wearing
a
broad
grin
ahineev
flushed
hang
it
he
thought
the
beast
will
go
now
and
talk
scandal
he
ll
disgrace
me
to
all
the
town
the
brute
ahineev
went
timidly
into
the
drawing
room
and
looked
stealthily
round
for
vankin
vankin
was
standing
by
the
piano
and
bending
down
with
a
jaunty
air
was
whispering
something
to
the
inspector
s
sister
in
law
who
was
laughing
talking
about
me
thought
ahineev
about
me
blast
him
and
she
believes
it
believes
it
she
laughs
mercy
on
us
no
i
can
t
let
it

i
can
t
i
must
do
something
to
prevent
his
being
believed
i
ll
speak
to
them
all
and
he
ll
be
shown
up
for
a
fool
and
a
gossip
ahineev
scratched
his
head
and
still
overcome
with
embarrassment
went
up
to
pasdequoi
i
ve
just
been
in
the
kitchen
to
see
after
the
supper
he
said
to
the
frenchman
i
know
you
are
fond
of
fish
and
i
ve
a
sturgeon
my
dear
fellow
beyond
everything
a
yard
and
a
half
long
ha
ha
ha
and
by
the
way
i
was
just
forgetting
in
the
kitchen
just
now
with
that
sturgeon
quite
a
little
story
i
went
into
the
kitchen
just
now
and
wanted
to
look
at
the
supper
dishes
i
looked
at
the
sturgeon
and
i
smacked
my
lips
with
relish
at
the
piquancy
of
it
and
at
the
very
moment
that
fool
vankin
came
in
and
said
ha
ha
ha
so
you
re
kissing
here
kissing
marfa
the
cook
what
a
thing
to
imagine
silly
fool
the
woman
is
a
perfect
fright
like
all
the
beasts
put
together
and
he
talks
about
kissing
queer
fish
who
s
a
queer
fish
asked
tarantulov
coming
up
why
he
over
there
vankin
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
he
told
the
story
of
vankin
he
amused
me
queer
fish
i
d
rather
kiss
a
dog
than
marfa
if
you
ask
me
added
ahineev
he
looked
round
and
saw
behind
him
mzda
we
were
talking
of
vankin
he
said
queer
fish
he
is
he
went
into
the
kitchen
saw
me
beside
marfa
and
began
inventing
all
sorts
of
silly
stories
why
are
you
kissing
he
says
he
must
have
had
a
drop
too
much
and
i
d
rather
kiss
a
turkeycock
than
marfa
i
said
and
i
ve
a
wife
of
my
own
you
fool
said
i
he
did
amuse
me
who
amused
you
asked
the
priest
who
taught
scripture
in
the
school
going
up
to
ahineev
vankin
i
was
standing
in
the
kitchen
you
know
looking
at
the
sturgeon
and
so
on
within
half
an
hour
or
so
all
the
guests
knew
the
incident
of
the
sturgeon
and
vankin
let
him
tell
away
now
thought
ahineev
rubbing
his
hands
let
him
he
ll
begin
telling
his
story
and
they
ll
say
to
him
at
once
enough
of
your
improbable
nonsense
you
fool
we
know
all
about
it
and
ahineev
was
so
relieved
that
in
his
joy
he
drank
four
glasses
too
many
after
escorting
the
young
people
to
their
room
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
like
an
innocent
babe
and
next
day
he
thought
no
more
of
the
incident
with
the
sturgeon
but
alas
man
proposes
but
god
disposes
an
evil
tongue
did
its
evil
work
and
ahineev
s
strategy
was
of
no
avail
just
a
week
later
to
be
precise
on
wednesday
after
the
third
lesson
when
ahineev
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
teacher
s
room
holding
forth
on
the
vicious
propensities
of
a
boy
called
visekin
the
head
master
went
up
to
him
and
drew
him
aside
look
here
sergei
kapitonich
said
the
head
master
you
must
excuse
me
it
s
not
my
business
but
all
the
same
i
must
make
you
realize
it
s
my
duty
you
see
there
are
rumors
that
you
are
romancing
with
that
cook
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
flirt
with
her
kiss
her
as
you
please
but
don
t
let
it
be
so
public
please
i
entreat
you
don
t
forget
that
you
re
a
schoolmaster
ahineev
turned
cold
and
faint
he
went
home
like
a
man
stung
by
a
whole
swarm
of
bees
like
a
man
scalded
with
boiling
water
as
he
walked
home
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
whole
town
was
looking
at
him
as
though
he
were
smeared
with
pitch
at
home
fresh
trouble
awaited
him
why
aren
t
you
gobbling
up
your
food
as
usual
his
wife
asked
him
at
dinner
what
are
you
so
pensive
about
brooding
over
your
amours
pining
for
your
marfa
i
know
all
about
it
mohammedan
kind
friends
have
opened
my
eyes
o
o
o
you
savage
and
she
slapped
him
in
the
face
he
got
up
from
the
table
not
feeling
the
earth
under
his
feet
and
without
his
hat
or
coat
made
his
way
to
vankin
he
found
him
at
home
you
scoundrel
he
addressed
him
why
have
you
covered
me
with
mud
before
all
the
town
why
did
you
set
this
slander
going
about
me
what
slander
what
are
you
talking
about
who
was
it
gossiped
of
my
kissing
marfa
wasn
t
it
you
tell
me
that
wasn
t
it
you
you
brigand
vankin
balinked
and
twitched
in
every
fibre
of
his
battered
countenance
raised
his
eyes
to
the
icon
and
articulated
god
blast
me
strike
me
blind
and
lay
me
out
if
i
said
a
single
word
about
you
may
i
be
left
without
house
and
home
may
i
be
stricken
with
worse
than
cholera
vankin
s
sincerity
did
not
admit
of
doubt
it
was
evidently
not
he
who
was
the
author
of
the
slander
but
who
then
who
ahineev
wondered
going
over
all
his
acquaintances
in
his
mind
and
beating
himself
on
the
breast
who
then
who
then
we
too
ask
the
reader
minds
in
ferment
from
the
annals
of
a
town
the
earth
was
like
an
oven
the
afternoon
sun
blazed
with
such
energy
that
even
the
thermometer
hanging
in
the
excise
officer
s
room
lost
its
head
it
ran
up
to
112
5
and
stopped
there
irresolute
the
inhabitants
streamed
with
perspiration
like
overdriven
horses
and
were
too
lazy
to
mop
their
faces
two
of
the
inhabitants
were
walking
along
the
market
place
in
front
of
the
closely
shuttered
houses
one
was
potcheshihin
the
local
treasury
clerk
and
the
other
was
optimov
the
agent
for
many
years
a
correspondent
of
the
son
of
the
fatherland
newspaper
they
walked
in
silence
speechless
from
the
heat
optimov
felt
tempted
to
find
fault
with
the
local
authorities
for
the
dust
and
disorder
of
the
market
place
but
aware
of
the
peace
loving
disposition
and
moderate
views
of
his
companion
he
said
nothing
in
the
middle
of
the
market
place
potcheshihin
suddenly
halted
and
began
gazing
into
the
sky
what
are
you
looking
at
those
starlings
that
flew
up
i
wonder
where
they
have
settled
clouds
and
clouds
of
them
if
one
were
to
go
and
take
a
shot
at
them
and
if
one
were
to
pick
them
up
and
if
they
have
settled
in
the
father
prebendary
s
garden
oh
no
they
are
not
in
the
father
prebendary
s
they
are
in
the
father
deacon
s
if
you
did
have
a
shot
at
them
from
here
you
wouldn
t
kill
anything
fine
shot
won
t
carry
so
far
it
loses
its
force
and
why
should
you
kill
them
anyway
they
re
birds
destructive
of
the
fruit
that
s
true
still
they
re
fowls
of
the
air
works
of
the
lord
the
starling
sings
you
know
and
what
does
it
sing
pray
a
song
of
praise
all
ye
fowls
of
the
air
praise
ye
the
lord
no
i
do
believe
they
have
settled
in
the
father
prebendary
s
garden
three
old
pilgrim
women
wearing
bark
shoes
and
carrying
wallets
passed
noiselessly
by
the
speakers
looking
enquiringly
at
the
gentlemen
who
were
for
some
unknown
reason
staring
at
the
father
prebendary
s
house
they
slackened
their
pace
and
when
they
were
a
few
yards
off
stopped
glanced
at
the
friends
once
more
and
then
fell
to
gazing
at
the
house
themselves
yes
you
were
right
they
have
settled
in
the
father
prebendary
s
said
optimov
his
cherries
are
ripe
now
so
they
have
gone
there
to
peck
them
from
the
garden
gate
emerged
the
father
prebendary
himself
accompanied
by
the
sexton
seeing
the
attention
directed
upon
his
abode
and
wondering
what
people
were
staring
at
he
stopped
and
he
too
as
well
as
the
sexton
began
looking
upwards
to
find
out
the
father
is
going
to
a
service
somewhere
i
suppose
said
potcheshihin
the
lord
be
his
succour
some
workmen
from
purov
s
factory
who
had
been
bathing
in
the
river
passed
between
the
friends
and
the
priest
seeing
the
latter
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
heavens
and
the
pilgrim
women
too
standing
motionless
with
their
eyes
turned
upwards
they
stood
still
and
stared
in
the
same
direction
a
small
boy
leading
a
blind
beggar
and
a
peasant
carrying
a
tub
of
stinking
fish
to
throw
into
the
market
place
did
the
same
there
must
be
something
the
matter
i
should
think
said
potcheshihin
a
fire
or
something
but
there
s
no
sign
of
smoke
anywhere
hey
kuzma
he
shouted
to
the
peasant
what
s
the
matter
the
peasant
made
some
reply
but
potcheshihin
and
optimov
did
not
catch
it
sleepy
looking
shopmen
made
their
appearance
at
the
doors
of
all
the
shops
some
plasterers
at
work
on
a
warehouse
near
left
their
ladders
and
joined
the
workmen
the
fireman
who
was
describing
circles
with
his
bare
feet
on
the
watch
tower
halted
and
after
looking
steadily
at
them
for
a
few
minutes
came
down
the
watch
tower
was
left
deserted
this
seemed
suspicious
there
must
be
a
fire

purov
s
birthday
to
morrow
the
starlings
rose
in
a
black
cloud
from
the
father
prebendary
s
garden
but
potcheshihin
and
optimov
did
not
notice
them
they
stood
staring
into
the
air
wondering
what
could
have
attracted
such
a
crowd
and
what
it
was
looking
at
akim
danilitch
appeared
still
munching
and
wiping
his
lips
he
cut
his
way
into
the
crowd
bellowing
firemen
be
ready
disperse
mr
optimov
disperse
or
it
ll
be
the
worse
for
you
instead
of
writing
all
kinds
of
things
about
decent
people
in
the
papers
you

better
try
to
behave
yourself
more
conformably
no
good

of
reading
the
papers
kindly

from
reflections
upon
literature
cried
optimov
hotly
i
am
a
literary
man
and
i
will
allow
no
one
to
make
reflections
upon
literature
though
as
is
the
duty

please
your

the
crowd
grew
larger
and
larger
there
is
no
telling
what
proportions
it
might
have
reached
if
the
new
organ
just
arrived
from
moscow
had
not
fortunately
begun
playing
in
the
tavern
close
by
hearing
their
favourite
tune
the
crowd
gasped
and
rushed
off
to
the
tavern
so
nobody
ever
knew
why
the
crowd
had
assembled
and
potcheshihin
and
optimov
had
by
now
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
starlings
who
were
innocently
responsible
for
the
proceedings
an
hour
later
the
town
was
still
and
silent
again
and
only
a
solitary
figure
was
to
be
seen
the
fireman
pacing
round
and
round
on
the
watch
tower
the
same
evening
akim
danilitch
sat
in
the
grocer
s
shop
drinking
limonade
gaseuse
and
brandy
and
writing
in
addition
to
the
official
report
i
venture
your
excellency
to
append
a
few
supplementary
observations
of
my
own
father
and
benefactor
in
very
truth
but
for
the
prayers
of
your
virtuous
spouse
in
her
salubrious
villa
near
our
town
there
s
no
knowing
what
might
not
have
come
to
pass
what
i
have
been
through
to
day
i
can
find
no
words
to
express
the
efficiency
of
krushensky
and
of
the
major
of
the
fire
brigade
are
beyond
all
praise
i
am
proud
of
such
devoted
servants
of
our
country
as
for
me
i
did
all
that
a
weak
man
could
do
whose
only
desire
is
the
welfare
of
his
neighbour
and
sitting
now
in
the
bosom
of
my
family
with
tears
in
my
eyes
i
thank
him
who
spared
us
bloodshed
in
absence
of
evidence
the
guilty
parties
remain
in
custody
but
i
propose
to
release
them
in
a
week
or
so
it
was
their
ignorance
that
led
them
astray
gone
astray
a
country
village
wrapped
in
the
darkness
of
night
one
o
clock
strikes
from
the
belfry
two
lawyers
called
kozyavkin

on

cackling
at
the
top
of
their
voices
flutter
down
the
village

kozyavkin
in

lachrymose
voice

i

i
can
t
understand
a
man
s
not
knowing
his
own
cottage
says
laev
indignantly
drunken
beast
if
i
d
known
i
was
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
i
would
never
have
come
with
you
i
should
have
been
at
home
and
fast
asleep
by
now
and
a
nice
fix
i
m
in
here
i
m
fearfully
done
up
and
thirsty
and
my
head
is
going
round
in
a
minute
in
a
minute
you
won
t
expire
a
big
cock
flies
crowing
over
laev
s
head
laev
heaves
a
deep
sigh
and
with
a
hopeless
gesture
sits
down
on
a
stone
he
is
beset
with
a
burning
thirst
his
eyes
are
closing
his
head
drops
forward
five
minutes
pass
ten
twenty
and
kozyavkin
is
still
busy
among
the
hens
petya
will
you
be
long
a
minute
i
found
the
portfolio
but
i
have
lost
it
again
laev
lays
his
head
on
his
fists
and
closes
his
eyes
the
cackling
of
the
fowls
grows
louder
and
louder
the
inhabitants
of
the
empty
cottage
fly
out
of
the
window
and
flutter
round
in
circles
he
fancies
like
owls
over
his
head
his
ears
ring
with
their
cackle
he
is
overwhelmed
with
terror
the
beast
he
thinks
he
invited
me
to
stay
promising
me
wine
and
junket
and
then
he
makes
me
walk
from
the
station
and
listen
to
these
hens
in
the
midst
of
his
indignation
his
chin
sinks
into
his
collar
he
lays
his
head
on
his
portfolio
and
gradually
subsides
weariness
gets
the
upper
hand
and
he
begins
to
doze
i
ve
found
the
portfolio
he
hears
kozyavkin
cry
triumphantly
i
shall
find
the
cape
in
a
minute
and
then
off
we
go
then
through
his
sleep
he
hears
the
barking
of
dogs
first
one
dog
barks
then
a
second
and
a
third
and
the
barking
of
the
dogs
blends
with
the
cackling
of
the
fowls
into
a
sort
of
savage
music
someone
comes
up
to
laev
and
asks
him
something
then
he
hears
someone
climb
over
his
head
into
the
window
then
a
knocking
and
a
shouting
a
woman
in
a
red
apron
stands
beside
him
with
a
lantern
in
her
hand
and
asks
him
something
you
ve
no
right
to
say
so
he
hears
kozyavkin
s
voice
i
am
a
lawyer
a
bachelor
of
laws
kozyavkin
here
s
my
visiting
card
what
do
i
want
with
your
card
says
someone
in
a
husky
bass
you
ve
disturbed
all
my
fowls
you
ve
smashed
the
eggs
look
what
you
ve
done
the
turkey
poults
were
to
have
come
out
to
day
or
to
morrow
and
you
ve
smashed
them
what
s
the
use
of
your
giving
me
your
card
sir
how
dare
you
interfere
with
me
no
i
won
t
have
it
i
am
thirsty
thinks
laev
trying
to
open
his
eyes
and
he
feels
somebody
climb
down
from
the
window
over
his
head
my
name
is
kozyavkin
i
have
a
cottage
here
everyone
knows
me
we
don
t
know
anyone
called
kozyavkin
what
are
you
saying
call
the
elder
he
knows
me
don
t
get
excited
the
constable
will
be
here
directly
we
know
all
the
summer
visitors
here
but
i
ve
never
seen
you
in
my
life
i
ve
had
a
cottage
in
rottendale
for
five
years
whew
do
you
take
this
for
the
dale
this
is
sicklystead
but
rottendale
is
farther
to
the
right
beyond
the
match
factory
it
s
three
miles
from
here
bless
my
soul
then
i
ve
taken
the
wrong
turning
the
cries
of
men
and
fowls
mingle
with
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
voice
of
kozyavkin
rises
above
the
chaos
of
confused
sounds
you
shut
up
i
ll
pay
i
ll
show
you
whom
you
have
to
deal
with
little
by
little
the
voices
die
down
laev
feels
himself
being
shaken
by
the
shoulder
an
avenger
shortly
after
finding
his
wife
in
flagrante
delicto
fyodor
fyodorovitch
sigaev
was
standing
in
schmuck
and
co
s
the
gunsmiths
selecting
a
suitable
revolver
his
countenance
expressed
wrath
grief
and
unalterable
determination
i
know
what
i
must
do
he
was
thinking
the
sanctities
of
the
home
are
outraged
honour
is
trampled
in
the
mud
vice
is
triumphant
and
therefore
as
a
citizen
and
a
man
of
honour
i
must
be
their
avenger
first
i
will
kill
her
and
her
lover
and
then
myself
he
had
not
yet
chosen
a
revolver
or
killed
anyone
but
already
in
imagination
he
saw
three
bloodstained
corpses
broken
skulls
brains
oozing
from
them
the
commotion
the
crowd
of
gaping
spectators
the
post
mortem
with
the
malignant
joy
of
an
insulted
man
he
pictured
the
horror
of
the
relations
and
the
public
the
agony
of
the
traitress
and
was
mentally
reading
leading
articles
on
the
destruction
of
the
traditions
of
the
home
the
shopman
a
sprightly
little
frenchified
figure
with
rounded
belly
and
white
waistcoat
displayed
the
revolvers
and
smiling
respectfully
and
scraping
with
his
little
feet
observed
i
would
advise
you
m
sieur
to
take
this
superb
revolver
the
smith
and
wesson
pattern
the
last
word
in
the
science
of
firearms
triple
action
with
ejector
kills
at
six
hundred
paces
central
sight
let
me
draw
your
attention
m
sieu
to
the
beauty
of
the
finish
the
most
fashionable
system
m
sieu
we
sell
a
dozen
every
day
for
burglars
wolves
and
lovers
very
correct
and
powerful
action
hits
at
a
great
distance
and
kills
wife
and
lover
with
one
bullet
as
for
suicide
m
sieu
i
don
t
know
a
better
pattern
the
shopman
pulled
and
cocked
the
trigger
breathed
on
the
barrel
took
aim
and
affected
to
be
breathless
with
delight
looking
at
his
ecstatic
countenance
one
might
have
supposed
that
he
would
readily
have
put
a
bullet
through
his
brains
if
he
had
only
possessed
a
revolver
of
such
a
superb
pattern
as
a
smith
wesson
and
what
price
asked
sigaev
forty
five
roubles
m
sieu
mm
that
s
too
dear
for
me
in
that
case
m
sieu
let
me
offer
you
another
make
somewhat
cheaper
here
if
you
ll
kindly
look
we
have
an
immense
choice
at
all
prices
here
for
instance
this
revolver
of
the
lefaucher
pattern
costs
only
eighteen
roubles
but
the
shopman
pursed
up
his
face
contemptuously
but
m
sieu
it
s
an
old
fashioned
make
they
are
only
bought
by
hysterical
ladies
or
the
mentally
deficient
to
commit
suicide
or
shoot
one
s
wife
with
a
lefaucher
revolver
is
considered
bad
form
nowadays
smith
wesson
is
the
only
pattern
that
s
correct
style
i
don
t
want
to
shoot
myself
or
to
kill
anyone
said
sigaev
lying
sullenly
i
am
buying
it
simply
for
a
country
cottage
to
frighten
away
burglars
that
s
not
our
business
what
object
you
have
in
buying
it
the
shopman
smiled
dropping
his
eyes
discreetly
if
we
were
to
investigate
the
object
in
each
case
m
sieu
we
should
have
to
close
our
shop
to
frighten
burglars
lefaucher
is
not
a
suitable
pattern
m
sieu
for
it
goes
off
with
a
faint
muffled
sound
i
would
suggest
mortimer
s
the
so
called
duelling
pistol
shouldn
t
i
challenge
him
to
a
duel
flashed
through
sigaev
s
mind
it
s
doing
him
too
much
honour
though
beasts
like
that
are
killed
like
dogs
the
shopman
swaying
gracefully
and
tripping
to
and
fro
on
his
little
feet
still
smiling
and
chattering
displayed
before
him
a
heap
of
revolvers
the
most
inviting
and
impressive
of
all
was
the
smith
and
wesson
s
sigaev
picked
up
a
pistol
of
that
pattern
gazed
blankly
at
it
and
sank
into
brooding
his
imagination
pictured
how
he
would
blow
out
their
brains
how
blood
would
flow
in
streams
over
the
rug
and
the
parquet
how
the
traitress
s
legs
would
twitch
in
her
last
agony
but
that
was
not
enough
for
his
indignant
soul
the
picture
of
blood
wailing
and
horror
did
not
satisfy
him
he
must
think
of
something
more
terrible
i
know
i
ll
kill
myself
and
him
he
thought
but
i
ll
leave
her
alive
let
her
pine
away
from
the
stings
of
conscience
and
the
contempt
of
all
surrounding
her
for
a
sensitive
nature
like
hers
that
will
be
far
more
agonizing
than
death
and
he
imagined
his
own
funeral
he
the
injured
husband
lies
in
his
coffin
with
a
gentle
smile
on
his
lips
and
she
pale
tortured
by
remorse
follows
the
coffin
like
a
niobe
not
knowing
where
to
hide
herself
to
escape
from
the
withering
contemptuous
looks
cast
upon
her
by
the
indignant
crowd
i
see
m
sieu
that
you
like
the
smith
and
wesson
make
the
shopman
broke
in
upon
his
broodings
if
you
think
it
too
dear
very
well
i
ll
knock
off
five
roubles
but
we
have
other
makes
cheaper
the
little
frenchified
figure
turned
gracefully
and
took
down
another
dozen
cases
of
revolvers
from
the
shelf
here
m
sieu
price
thirty
roubles
that
s
not
expensive
especially
as
the
rate
of
exchange
has
dropped
terribly
and
the
customs
duties
are
rising
every
hour
m
sieu
i
vow
i
am
a
conservative
but
even
i
am
beginning
to
murmur
why
with
the
rate
of
exchange
and
the
customs
tariff
only
the
rich
can
purchase
firearms
there
s
nothing
left
for
the
poor
but
tula
weapons
and
phosphorus
matches
and
tula
weapons
are
a
misery
you
may
aim
at
your
wife
with
a
tula
revolver
and
shoot
yourself
through
the
shoulder
blade
sigaev
suddenly
felt
mortified
and
sorry
that
he
would
be
dead
and
would
miss
seeing
the
agonies
of
the
traitress
revenge
is
only
sweet
when
one
can
see
and
taste
its
fruits
and
what
sense
would
there
be
in
it
if
he
were
lying
in
his
coffin
knowing
nothing
about
it
hadn
t
i
better
do
this
he
pondered
i
ll
kill
him
then
i
ll
go
to
his
funeral
and
look
on
and
after
the
funeral
i
ll
kill
myself
they
d
arrest
me
though
before
the
funeral
and
take
away
my
pistol
and
so
i
ll
kill
him
she
shall
remain
alive
and
i
for
the
time
i
ll
not
kill
myself
but
go
and
be
arrested
i
shall
always
have
time
to
kill
myself
there
will
be
this
advantage
about
being
arrested
that
at
the
preliminary
investigation
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
exposing
to
the
authorities
and
to
the
public
all
the
infamy
of
her
conduct
if
i
kill
myself
she
may
with
her
characteristic
duplicity
and
impudence
throw
all
the
blame
on
me
and
society
will
justify
her
behaviour
and
will
very
likely
laugh
at
me
if
i
remain
alive
then
a
minute
later
he
was
thinking
yes
if
i
kill
myself
i
may
be
blamed
and
suspected
of
petty
feeling
besides
why
should
i
kill
myself
that
s
one
thing
and
for
another
to
shoot
oneself
is
cowardly
and
so
i
ll
kill
him
and
let
her
live
and
i
ll
face
my
trial
i
shall
be
tried
and
she
will
be
brought
into
court
as
a
witness
i
can
imagine
her
confusion
her
disgrace
when
she
is
examined
by
my
counsel
the
sympathies
of
the
court
of
the
press
and
of
the
public
will
certainly
be
with
me
while
he
deliberated
the
shopman
displayed
his
wares
and
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
entertain
his
customer
here
are
english
ones
a
new
pattern
only
just
received
he
prattled
on
but
i
warn
you
m
sieu
all
these
systems
pale
beside
the
smith
and
wesson
the
other
day
as
i
dare
say
you
have
read
an
officer
bought
from
us
a
smith
and
wesson
he
shot
his
wife
s
lover
and
would
you
believe
it
the
bullet
passed
through
him
pierced
the
bronze
lamp
then
the
piano
and
ricochetted
back
from
the
piano
killing
the
lap
dog
and
bruising
the
wife
a
magnificent
record
redounding
to
the
honour
of
our
firm
the
officer
is
now
under
arrest
he
will
no
doubt
be
convicted
and
sent
to
penal
servitude
in
the
first
place
our
penal
code
is
quite
out
of
date
and
secondly
m
sieu
the
sympathies
of
the
court
are
always
with
the
lover
why
is
it
very
simple
m
sieu
the
judges
and
the
jury
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
the
defence
are
all
living
with
other
men
s
wives
and
it
ll
add
to
their
comfort
that
there
will
be
one
husband
the
less
in
russia
society
would
be
pleased
if
the
government
were
to
send
all
the
husbands
to
sahalin
oh
m
sieu
you
don
t
know
how
it
excites
my
indignation
to
see
the
corruption
of
morals
nowadays
to
love
other
men
s
wives
is
as
much
the
regular
thing
to
day
as
to
smoke
other
men
s
cigarettes
and
to
read
other
men
s
books
every
year
our
trade
gets
worse
and
worse
it
doesn
t
mean
that
wives
are
more
faithful
but
that
husbands
resign
themselves
to
their
position
and
are
afraid
of
the
law
and
penal
servitude
the
shopman
looked
round
and
whispered
and
whose
fault
is
it
m
sieu
the
government
s
to
go
to
sahalin
for
the
sake
of
a
pig
like
that
there
s
no
sense
in
that
either
sigaev
pondered
if
i
go
to
penal
servitude
it
will
only
give
my
wife
an
opportunity
of
marrying
again
and
deceiving
a
second
husband
she
would
triumph
and
so
i
will
leave
her
alive
i
won
t
kill
myself
him
i
won
t
kill
either
i
must
think
of
something
more
sensible
and
more
effective
i
will
punish
them
with
my
contempt
and
will
take
divorce
proceedings
that
will
make
a
scandal
here
m
sieu
is
another
make
said
the
shopman
taking
down
another
dozen
from
the
shelf
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
original
mechanism
of
the
lock
in
view
of
his
determination
a
revolver
was
now
of
no
use
to
sigaev
but
the
shopman
meanwhile
getting
more
and
more
enthusiastic
persisted
in
displaying
his
wares
before
him
the
outraged
husband
began
to
feel
ashamed
that
the
shopman
should
be
taking
so
much
trouble
on
his
account
for
nothing
that
he
should
be
smiling
wasting
time
displaying
enthusiasm
for
nothing
very
well
in
that
case
he
muttered
i
ll
look
in
again
later
on
or
i
ll
send
someone
he
didn
t
see
the
expression
of
the
shopman
s
face
but
to
smooth
over
the
awkwardness
of
the
position
a
little
he
felt
called
upon
to
make
some
purchase
but
what
should
he
buy
he
looked
round
the
walls
of
the
shop
to
pick
out
something
inexpensive
and
his
eyes
rested
on
a
green
net
hanging
near
the
door
that
s
what
s
that
he
asked
that
s
a
net
for
catching
quails
and
what
price
is
it
eight
roubles
m
sieu
wrap
it
up
for
me
the
outraged
husband
paid
his
eight
roubles
took
the
net
and
feeling
even
more
outraged
walked
out
of
the
shop
the
jeune
premier
yevgeny
alexeyitch
podzharov
the
jeune
premier
a
graceful
elegant
young
man
with
an
oval
face
and
little
bags
under
his
eyes
had
come
for
the
season
to
one
of
the
southern
towns
of
russia
and
tried
at
once
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
few
of
the
leading
families
of
the
place
yes
signor
he
would
often
say
gracefully
swinging
his
foot
and
displaying
his
red
socks
an
artist
ought
to
act
upon
the
masses
both
directly
and
indirectly
the
first
aim
is
attained
by
his
work
on
the
stage
the
second
by
an
acquaintance
with
the
local
inhabitants
on
my
honour
parole
d
honneur
i
don
t
understand
why
it
is
we
actors
avoid
making
acquaintance
with
local
families
why
is
it
to
say
nothing
of
dinners
name
day
parties
feasts
soir
es
fixes
to
say
nothing
of
these
entertainments
think
of
the
moral
influence
we
may
have
on
society
is
it
not
agreeable
to
feel
one
has
dropped
a
spark
in
some
thick
skull
the
types
one
meets
the
women
mon

what
women
they
turn

into
some
huge

picks
out

parole

in
the
southern
town
among
other
estimable
families
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
that
of
a
manufacturer
called
zybaev
whenever
he
remembers
that
acquaintance
now
he
frowns
contemptuously
screws
up
his
eyes
and
nervously
plays
with
his
watch
chain
one
day
it
was
at
a
name
day
party
at
zybaev
s
the
actor
was
sitting
in
his
new
friends
drawing
room
and
holding
forth
as
usual
around
him
types
were
sitting
in
armchairs
and
on
the
sofa
listening
affably
from
the
next
room
came
feminine
laughter
and
the
sounds
of
evening
tea
crossing
his
legs
after
each
phrase
sipping
tea
with
rum
in
it
and
trying
to
assume
an
expression
of
careless
boredom
he
talked
of
his
stage
triumphs
i
am
a
provincial
actor
principally
he
said
smiling
condescendingly
but
i
have
played
in
petersburg
and
moscow
too
by
the
way
i
will
describe
an
incident
which
illustrates
pretty
well
the
state
of
mind
of
to
day
at
my
benefit
in
moscow
the
young
people
brought
me
such
a
mass
of
laurel
wreaths
that
i
swear
by
all
i
hold
sacred
i
did
not
know
where
to
put
them
parole
d
honneur
later
on
at
a
moment
when
funds
were
short
i
took
the
laurel
wreaths
to
the
shop
and
guess
what
they
weighed
eighty
pounds
altogether
ha
ha
you
can
t
think
how
useful
the
money
was
artists
indeed
are
often
hard
up
to
day
i
have
hundreds
thousands
tomorrow
nothing
to
day
i
haven
t
a
crust
of
bread
to
morrow
i
have
oysters
and
anchovies
hang
it
all
the
local
inhabitants
sipped
their
glasses
decorously
and
listened
the
well
pleased
host
not
knowing
how
to
make
enough
of
his
cultured
and
interesting
visitor
presented
to
him
a
distant
relative
who
had
just
arrived
one
pavel
ignatyevitch
klimov
a
bulky
gentleman
about
forty
wearing
a
long
frock
coat
and
very
full
trousers
you
ought
to
know
each
other
said
zybaev
as
he
presented
klimov
he
loves
theatres
and
at
one
time
used
to
act
himself
he
has
an
estate
in
the
tula
province
podzharov
and
klimov
got
into
conversation
it
appeared
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
both
that
the
tula
landowner
lived
in
the
very
town
in
which
the
jeune
premier
had
acted
for
two
seasons
in
succession
enquiries
followed
about
the
town
about
common
acquaintances
and
about
the
theatre
do
you
know
i
like
that
town
awfully
said
the
jeune
premier
displaying
his
red
socks
what
streets
what
a
charming
park
and
what
society
delightful
society
yes
delightful
society
the
landowner
assented
a
commercial
town
but
extremely
cultured
for
instance
er
er
er
the
head
master
of
the
high
school
the
public
prosecutor
the
officers
the
police
captain
too
was
not
bad
a
man
as
the
french
say
enchant
and
the
women
allah
what
women
yes
the
women
certainly
perhaps
i
am
partial
the
fact
is
that
in
your
town
i
don
t
know
why
i
was
devilishly
lucky
with
the
fair
sex
i
could
write
a
dozen
novels
to
take
this
episode
for
instance
i
was
staying
in
yegoryevsky
street
in
the
very
house
where
the
treasury
is
the
red
house
without
stucco
yes
yes
without
stucco
close
by
as
i
remember
now
lived
a
local
beauty
varenka
not
varvara
nikolayevna
asked
klimov
and
he
beamed
with
satisfaction
she
really
is
a
beauty
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
town
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
town
a
classic
profile
great
black
eyes
and
hair
to
her
waist
she
saw
me
in
hamlet
she
wrote
me
a
letter
la
pushkin
s
tatyana
i
answered
as
you
may
guess
podzharov
looked
round
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
there
were
no
ladies
in
the
room
rolled
his
eyes
smiled
mournfully
and
heaved
a
sigh
i
came
home
one
evening
after
a
performance
he
whispered
and
there
she
was
sitting
on
my
sofa
there
followed
tears
protestations
of
love
kisses
oh
that
was
a
marvellous
that
was
a
divine
night
our
romance
lasted
two
months
but
that
night
was
never
repeated
it
was
a
night
parole
d
honneur
excuse
me
what
s
that
muttered
klimov
turning
crimson
and
gazing
open
eyed
at
the
actor
i
know
varvara
nikolayevna
well
she
s
my
niece
podzharov
was
embarrassed
and
he
too
opened
his
eyes
wide
how
s
this
klimov
went
on
throwing
up
his
hands
i
know
the
girl
and
and
i
am
surprised
i
am
very
sorry
this
has
come
up
muttered
the
actor
getting
up
and
rubbing
something
out
of
his
left
eye
with
his
little
finger
though
of
course
of
course
you
as
her
uncle
the
other
guests
who
had
hitherto
been
listening
to
the
actor
with
pleasure
and
rewarding
him
with
smiles
were
embarrassed
and
dropped
their
eyes
please
do
be
so
good
take
your
words
back
said
klimov
in
extreme
embarrassment
i
beg
you
to
do
so
if
er
er
er
it
offends
you
certainly
answered
the
actor
with
an
undefined
movement
of
his
hand
and
confess
you
have
told
a
falsehood
i
no
er
er
er
it
was
not
a
lie
but
i
greatly
regret
having
spoken
too
freely
and
in
fact
i
don
t
understand
your
tone
klimov
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
silence
as
though
in
uncertainty
and
hesitation
his
fleshy
face
grew
more
and
more
crimson
and
the
veins
in
his
neck
swelled
up
after
walking
up
and
down
for
about
two
minutes
he
went
up
to
the
actor
and
said
in
a
tearful
voice
no
do
be
so
good
as
to
confess
that
you
told
a
lie
about
varenka
have
the
goodness
to
do
so
it
s
queer
said
the
actor
with
a
strained
smile
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
swinging
his
leg
this
is
positively
insulting
so
you
will
not
confess
it
i
do
on
t
understand
you
will
not
in
that
case
excuse
me
i
shall
have
to
resort
to
unpleasant
measures
either
sir
i
shall
insult
you
at
once
on
the
spot
or
if
you
are
an
honourable
man
you
will
kindly
accept
my
challenge
to
a
duel
we
will
fight
certainly
rapped
out
the
jeune
premier
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
certainly
extremely
perturbed
the
guests
and
the
host
not
knowing
what
to
do
drew
klimov
aside
and
began
begging
him
not
to
get
up
a
scandal
astonished
feminine
countenances
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
jeune
premier
turned
round
said
a
few
words
and
with
an
air
of
being
unable
to
remain
in
a
house
where
he
was
insulted
took
his
cap
and
made
off
without
saying
good
bye
on
his
way
home
the
jeune
premier
smiled
contemptuously
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
when
he
reached
his
hotel
room
and
stretched
himself
on
his
sofa
he
felt
exceedingly
uneasy
the
devil
take
him
he
thought
a
duel
does
not
matter
he
won
t
kill
me
but
the
trouble
is
the
other
fellows
will
hear
of
it
and
they
know
perfectly
well
it
was
a
yarn
it
s
abominable
i
shall
be
disgraced
all
over
russia
podzharov
thought
a
little
smoked
and
to
calm
himself
went
out
into
the
street
i
ought
to
talk
to
this
bully
ram
into
his
stupid
noddle
that
he
is
a
blockhead
and
a
fool
and
that
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
him
the
jeune
premier
stopped
before
zybaev
s
house
and
looked
at
the
windows
lights
were
still
burning
behind
the
muslin
curtains
and
figures
were
moving
about
i
ll
wait
for
him
the
actor
decided
it
was
dark
and
cold
a
hateful
autumn
rain
was
drizzling
as
though
through
a
sieve
podzharov
leaned
his
elbow
on
a
lamp
post
and
abandoned
himself
to
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
he
was
wet
through
and
exhausted
at
two
o
clock
in
the
night
the
guests
began
coming
out
of
zybaev
s
house
the
landowner
from
tula
was
the
last
to
make
his
appearance
he
heaved
a
sigh
that
could
be
heard
by
the
whole
street
and
scraped
the
pavement
with
his
heavy
overboots
excuse
me
said
the
jeune
premier
overtaking
him
one
minute
klimov
stopped
the
actor
gave
a
smile
hesitated
and
began
stammering
i
i
confess
i
told
a
lie
no
sir
you
will
please
confess
that
publicly
said
klimov
and
he
turned
crimson
again
i
can
t
leave
it
like
that
but
you
see
i
am
apologizing
i
beg
you
don
t
you
understand
i
beg
you
because
you
will
admit
a
duel
will
make
talk
and
i
am
in
a
position
my
fellow
actors
goodness
knows
what
they
may
think
the
jeune
premier
tried
to
appear
unconcerned
to
smile
to
stand
erect
but
his
body
would
not
obey
him
his
voice
trembled
his
eyes
balinked
guiltily
and
his
head
drooped
for
a
good
while
he
went
on
muttering
something
klimov
listened
to
him
thought
a
little
and
heaved
a
sigh
well
so
be
it
he
said
may
god
forgive
you
only
don
t
lie
in
future
young
man
nothing
degrades
a
man
like
lying
yes
indeed
you
are
a
young
man
you
have
had
a
good
education
the
landowner
from
tula
in
a
benignant
fatherly
way
gave
him
a
lecture
while
the
jeune
premier
listened
and
smiled
meekly
when
it
was
over
he
smirked
bowed
and
with
a
guilty
step
and
a
crestfallen
air
set
off
for
his
hotel
as
he
went
to
bed
half
an
hour
later
he
felt
that
he
was
out
of
danger
and
was
already
in
excellent
spirits
serene
and
satisfied
that
the
misunderstanding
had
ended
so
satisfactorily
he
wrapped
himself
in
the
bedclothes
soon
fell
asleep
and
slept
soundly
till
ten
o
clock
next
morning
a
defenceless
creature
in
spite
of
a
violent
attack
of
gout
in
the
night
and
the
nervous
exhaustion
left
by
it
kistunov
went
in
the
morning
to
his
office
and
began
punctually
seeing
the
clients
of
the
bank
and
persons
who
had
come
with
petitions
he
looked
languid
and
exhausted
and
spoke
in
a
faint
voice
hardly
above
a
whisper
as
though
he
were
dying
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
a
lady
in
an
antediluvian
mantle
whose
back
view
was
extremely
suggestive
of
a
huge
dung
beetle
you
see
your
excellency
the
petitioner
in
question
began
speaking
rapidly
my
husband
shtchukin
a
collegiate
assessor
was
ill
for
five
months
and
while
he
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
was
laid
up
at
home
he
was
for
no
sort
of
reason
dismissed
your
excellency
and
when
i
went
for
his
salary
they
deducted
if
you
please
your
excellency
twenty
four
roubles
thirty
six
kopecks
from
his
salary
what
for
i
asked
he
borrowed
from
the
club
fund
they
told
me
and
the
other
clerks
had
stood
security
for
him
how
was
that
how
could
he
have
borrowed
it
without
my
consent
it
s
impossible
your
excellency
what
s
the
reason
of
it
i
am
a
poor
woman
i
earn
my
bread
by
taking
in
lodgers
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
have
to
put
up
with
ill
usage
from
everyone
and
never
hear
a
kind
word
the
petitioner
was
balinking
and
dived
into
her
mantle
for
her
handkerchief
kistunov
took
her
petition
from
her
and
began
reading
it
excuse
me
what
s
this
he
asked
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
evidently
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
place
madam
your
petition
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
at
all
you
will
have
to
apply
to
the
department
in
which
your
husband
was
employed
why
my
dear
sir
i
have
been
to
five
places
already
and
they
would
not
even
take
the
petition
anywhere
said
madame
shtchukin
i
d
quite
lost
my
head
but
thank
goodness
god
bless
him
for
it
my
son
in
law
boris
matveyitch
advised
me
to
come
to
you
you
go
to
mr
kistunov
mamma
he
is
an
influential
man
he
can
do
anything
for
you
help
me
your
excellency
we
can
do
nothing
for
you
madame
shtchukin
you
must
understand
your
husband
served
in
the
army
medical
department
and
our
establishment
is
a
purely
private
commercial
undertaking
a
bank
surely
you
must
understand
that
kistunov
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
and
turned
to
a
gentleman
in
a
military
uniform
with
a
swollen
face
your
excellency
piped
madame
shtchukin
in
a
pitiful
voice
i
have
the
doctor
s
certificate
that
my
husband
was
ill
here
it
is
if
you
will
kindly
look
at
it
very
good
i
believe
you
kistunov
said
irritably
but
i
repeat
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
it
s
queer
and
positively
absurd
surely
your
husband
must
know
where
you
are
to
apply
he
knows
nothing
your
excellency
he
keeps
on
it
s
not
your
business
get
away
that
s
all
i
can
get
out
of
him
whose
business
is
it
then
it
s
i
have
to
keep
them
all
kistunov
again
turned
to
madame
shtchukin
and
began
explaining
to
her
the
difference
between
the
army
medical
department
and
a
private
bank
she
listened
attentively
nodded
in
token
of
assent
and
said
yes
yes
yes
i
understand
sir
in
that
case
your
excellency
tell
them
to
pay
me
fifteen
roubles
at
least
i
agree
to
take
part
on
account
ough
sighed
kistunov
letting
his
head
drop
back
there
s
no
making
you
see
reason
do
understand
that
to
apply
to
us
with
such
a
petition
is
as
strange
as
to
send
in
a
petition
concerning
divorce
for
instance
to
a
chemist
s
or
to
the
assaying
board
you
have
not
been
paid
your
due
but
what
have
we
to
do
with
it
your
excellency
make
me
remember
you
in
my
prayers
for
the
rest
of
my
days
have
pity
on
a
lone
lorn
woman
wailed
madame
shtchukin
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
am
worried
to
death
i
ve
to
settle
with
the
lodgers
and
see
to
my
husband
s
affairs
and
fly
round
looking
after
the
house
and
i
am
going
to
church
every
day
this
week
and
my
son
in
law
is
out
of
a
job
i
might
as
well
not
eat
or
drink
i
can
scarcely
keep
on
my
feet
i
haven
t
slept
all
night
kistunov
was
conscious
of
the
palpitation
of
his
heart
with
a
face
of
anguish
pressing
his
hand
on
his
heart
he
began
explaining
to
madame
shtchukin
again
but
his
voice
failed
him
no
excuse
me
i
can
not
talk
to
you
he
said
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
my
head
s
going
round
you
are
hindering
us
and
wasting
your
time
ough
alexey
nikolaitch
he
said
addressing
one
of
his
clerks
please
will
you
explain
to
madame
shtchukin
kistunov
passing
by
all
the
petitioners
went
to
his
private
room
and
signed
about
a
dozen
papers
while
alexey
nikolaitch
was
still
engaged
with
madame
shtchukin
as
he
sat
in
his
room
kistunov
heard
two
voices
the
monotonous
restrained
bass
of
alexey
nikolaitch
and
the
shrill
wailing
voice
of
madame
shtchukin
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
am
a
woman
in
delicate
health
said
madame
shtchukin
i
look
strong
but
if
you
were
to
overhaul
me
there
is
not
one
healthy
fibre
in
me
i
can
scarcely
keep
on
my
feet
and
my
appetite
is
gone
i
drank
my
cup
of
coffee
this
morning
without
the
slightest
relish
alexey
nikolaitch
explained
to
her
the
difference
between
the
departments
and
the
complicated
system
of
sending
in
papers
he
was
soon
exhausted
and
his
place
was
taken
by
the
accountant
a
wonderfully
disagreeable
woman
said
kistunov
revolted
nervously
cracking
his
fingers
and
continually
going
to
the
decanter
of
water
she
s
a
perfect
idiot
she
s
worn
me
out
and
she
ll
exhaust
them
the
nasty
creature
ough
my
heart
is
throbbing
half
an
hour
later
he
rang
his
bell
alexey
nikolaitch
made
his
appearance
how
are
things
going
kistunov
asked
languidly
we
can
t
make
her
see
anything
pyotr
alexandritch
we
are
simply
done
we
talk
of
one
thing
and
she
talks
of
something
else
i
i
can
t
stand
the
sound
of
her
voice
i
am
ill
i
can
t
bear
it
send
for
the
porter
pyotr
alexandritch
let
him
put
her
out
no
no
cried
kistunov
in
alarm
she
will
set
up
a
squeal
and
there
are
lots
of
flats
in
this
building
and
goodness
knows
what
they
would
think
of
us
do
try
and
explain
to
her
my
dear
fellow
a
minute
later
the
deep
drone
of
alexey
nikolaitch
s
voice
was
audible
again
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
instead
of
his
bass
there
was
the
murmur
of
the
accountant
s
powerful
tenor
re
mark
ably
nasty
woman
kistunov
thought
indignantly
nervously
shrugging
his
shoulders
no
more
brains
than
a
sheep
i
believe
that
s
a
twinge
of
the
gout
again
my
migraine
is
coming
back
in
the
next
room
alexey
nikolaitch
at
the
end
of
his
resources
at
last
tapped
his
finger
on
the
table
and
then
on
his
own
forehead
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
you
haven
t
a
head
on
your
shoulders
he
said
but
this
come
come
said
the
old
lady
offended
talk
to
your
own
wife
like
that
you
screw
don
t
be
too
free
with
your
hands
and
looking
at
her
with
fury
with
exasperation
as
though
he
would
devour
her
alexey
nikolaitch
said
in
a
quiet
stifled
voice
clear
out
wha
at
squealed
madame
shtchukin
how
dare
you
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
won
t
endure
it

law
of
three
lodgers
and
i
will

at
my
feet
for
your
saucy
words
i
ll
go
to
your
general

excellency

excellency

off
you
pest
hissed
alexey
nikolaitch
kistunov
opened
his
door
and
looked
into
the
office
what
is
it
he
asked
in
a
tearful
voice
madame
shtchukin
as
red
as
a
crab
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
rolling
her
eyes
and
prodding
the
air
with
her
fingers
the
bank
clerks
were
standing
round
red
in
the
face
too
and
evidently
harassed
were
looking
at
each
other
distractedly
your
excellency
cried
madame
shtchukin
pouncing
upon
kistunov
here
this
man
he
here
this
man
she
pointed
to
alexey
nikolaitch
tapped
himself
on
the
forehead
and
then
tapped
the
table
you
told
him
to
go
into
my
case
and
he
s
jeering
at
me
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
my
husband
is
a
collegiate
assessor
and
i
am
a
major
s
daughter
myself
very
good
madam
moaned
kistunov
i
will
go
into
it
i
will
take
steps
go
away
later
and
when
shall
i
get
the
money
your
excellency
i
need
it
to
day
kistunov
passed
his
trembling
hand
over
his
forehead
heaved
a
sigh
and
began
explaining
again
madam
i
have
told
you
already
this
is
a
bank
a
private
commercial
establishment
what
do
you
want
of
us
and
do
understand
that
you
are
hindering
us
madame
shtchukin
listened
to
him
and
sighed
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
she
assented
only
your
excellency
do
me
the
kindness
make
me
pray
for
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
be
a
father
protect
me
if
a
medical
certificate
is
not
enough
i
can
produce
an
affidavit
from
the
police
tell
them
to
give
me
the
money
everything
began
swimming
before
kistunov
s
eyes
he
breathed
out
all
the
air
in
his
lungs
in
a
prolonged
sigh
and
sank
helpless
on
a
chair
how
much
do
you
want
he
asked
in
a
weak
voice
twenty
four
roubles
and
thirty
six
kopecks
kistunov
took
his
pocket
book
out
of
his
pocket
extracted
a
twenty
five
rouble
note
and
gave
it
to
madame
shtchukin
take
it
and
and
go
away
madame
shtchukin
wrapped
the
money
up
in
her
handkerchief
put
it
away
and
pursing
up
her
face
into
a
sweet
mincing
even
coquettish
smile
asked
your
excellency
and
would
it
be
possible
for
my
husband
to
get
a
post
again
i
am
going
i
am
ill
said
kistunov
in
a
weary
voice
i
have
dreadful
palpitations
when
he
had
driven
home
alexey
nikolaitch
sent
nikita
for
some
laurel
drops
and
after
taking
twenty
drops
each
all
the
clerks
set
to
work
while
madame
shtchukin
stayed
another
two
hours
in
the
vestibule
talking
to
the
porter
and
waiting
for
kistunov
to
return
she
came
again
next
day
an
enigmatic
nature
on
the
red
velvet
seat
of
a
first
class
railway
carriage
a
pretty
lady
sits
half
reclining
an
expensive
fluffy
fan
trembles
in
her
tightly
closed
fingers
a
pince
nez
keeps
dropping
off
her
pretty
little
nose
the
brooch
heaves
and
falls
on
her
bosom
like
a
boat
on
the
ocean
she
is
greatly
agitated
on
the
seat
opposite
sits
the
provincial
secretary
of
special
commissions
a
budding
young
author
who
from
time
to
time
publishes
long
stories
of
high
life
or
novelli
as
he
calls
them
in
the
leading
paper
of
the
province
he
is
gazing
into
her
face
gazing
intently
with
the
eyes
of
a
connoisseur
he
is
watching
studying
catching
every
shade
of
this
exceptional
enigmatic
nature
he
understands
it
he
fathoms
it
her
soul
her
whole
psychology
lies
open
before
him
oh
i
understand
i
understand
you
to
your
inmost
depths
says
the
secretary
of
special
commissions
kissing
her
hand
near
the
bracelet
your
sensitive
responsive
soul
is
seeking
to
escape
from
the
maze
of
yes
the
struggle
is
terrific
titanic
but
do
not
lose
heart
you
will
be
triumphant
yes
write
about
me
voldemar
says
the
pretty
lady
with
a
mournful
smile
my
life
has
been
so
full
so
varied
so
chequered
above
all
i
am
unhappy
i
am
a
suffering
soul
in
some
page
of
dostoevsky
reveal
my
soul
to
the
world
voldemar
reveal
that
hapless
soul
you
are
a
psychologist
we
have
not
been
in
the
train
an
hour
together
and
you
have
already
fathomed
my
heart
tell
me
i
beseech
you
tell
me
listen
my
father
was
a
poor
clerk
in
the
service
he
had
a
good
heart
and
was
not
without
intelligence
but
the
spirit
of
the
age
of
his
environment
vous
comprenez
i
do
not
blame
my
poor
father
he
drank
gambled
took
bribes
my
mother
but
why
say
more
poverty
the
struggle
for
daily
bread
the
consciousness
of
insignificance
ah
do
not
force
me
to
recall
it
i
had
to
make
my
own
way
you
know
the
monstrous
education
at
a
boarding
school
foolish
novel
reading
the
errors
of
early
youth
the
first
timid
flutter
of
love
it
was
awful
the
vacillation
and
the
agonies
of
losing
faith
in
life
in
oneself
ah
you
are
an
author
you
know
us
women
you
will
understand
unhappily
i
have
an
intense
nature
i
looked
for
happiness
and
what
happiness
i
longed
to
set
my
soul
free
yes
in
that
i
saw
my
happiness
exquisite
creature
murmured
the
author
kissing
her
hand
close
to
the
bracelet
it
s
not
you
i
am
kissing
but
the
suffering
of
humanity
do
you
remember
raskolnikov
and
his
kiss
oh
voldemar
i
longed
for
glory
renown
success
like
every
why
affect
modesty
every
nature
above
the
commonplace
i
yearned
for
something
extraordinary
above
the
common
lot
of
woman
and
then
and
then
there
crossed
my
path
an
old
general
very
well
off
understand
me
voldemar
it
was
self
sacrifice
renunciation
you
must
see
that
i
could
do
nothing
else
i
restored
the
family
fortunes
was
able
to
travel
to
do
good
yet
how
i
suffered
how
revolting
how
loathsome
to
me
were
his
embraces
though
i
will
be
fair
to
him
he
had
fought
nobly
in
his
day
there
were
moments
terrible
moments
but
i
was
kept
up
by
the
thought
that
from
day
to
day
the
old
man
might
die
that
then
i
would
begin
to
live
as
i
liked
to
give
myself
to
the
man
i
adore
be
happy
there
is
such
a
man
voldemar
indeed
there
is
the
pretty
lady
flutters
her
fan
more
violently
her
face
takes
a
lachrymose
expression
she
goes
on
but
at
last
the
old
man
died
he
left
me
something
i
was
free
as
a
bird
of
the
air
now
is
the
moment
for
me
to
be
happy
isn
t
it
voldemar
happiness
comes
tapping
at
my
window
i
had
only
to
let
it
in
but
voldemar
listen
i
implore
you
now
is
the
time
for
me
to
give
myself
to
the
man
i
love
to
become
the
partner
of
his
life
to
help
to
uphold
his
ideals
to
be
happy
to
find
rest
but
how
ignoble
repulsive
and
senseless
all
our
life
is
how
mean
it
all
is
voldemar
i
am
wretched
wretched
wretched
again
there
is
an
obstacle
in
my
path
again
i
feel
that
my
happiness
is
far
far
away
ah
what
anguish
if
only
you
knew
what
anguish
but
what
what
stands
in
your
way
i
implore
you
tell
me
what
is
it
another
old
general
very
well
off
the
broken
fan
conceals
the
pretty
little
face
the
author
props
on
his
fist
his
thought
heavy
brow
and
ponders
with
the
air
of
a
master
in
psychology
the
engine
is
whistling
and
hissing
while
the
window
curtains
flush
red
with
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
a
happy
man
the
passenger
train
is
just
starting
from
bologoe
the
junction
on
the
petersburg
moscow
line
in
a
second
class
smoking
compartment
five
passengers
sit
dozing
shrouded
in
the
twilight
of
the
carriage
they
had
just
had
a
meal
and
now
snugly
ensconced
in
their
seats
they
are
trying
to
go
to
sleep
stillness
the
door
opens
and
in
there
walks
a
tall
lanky
figure
straight
as
a
poker
with
a
ginger
coloured
hat
and
a
smart
overcoat
wonderfully
suggestive
of
a
journalist
in
jules
verne
or
on
the
comic
stage
the
figure
stands
still
in
the
middle
of
the
compartment
for
a
long
while
breathing
heavily
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
peering
at
the
seats
no
wrong
again
he
mutters
what
the
deuce
it
s
positively
revolting
no
the
wrong
one
again
one
of
the
passengers
stares
at
the
figure
and
utters
a
shout
of
joy
ivan
alexyevitch
what
brings
you
here
is
it
you
the
poker
like
gentleman
starts
stares
blankly
at
the
passenger
and
recognizing
him
claps
his
hands
with
delight
ha
pyotr
petrovitch
he
says
how
many
summers
how
many
winters
i
didn
t
know
you
were
in
this
train
how
are

unsteadily

he

i
stepped
out
just
after
the
second
bell
to
get
a
glass
of
brandy
i
got
it
of
course
well
i
thought
since
it
s
a
long
way
to
the
next
station
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
a
second
glass
while
i
was
thinking
about
it
and
drinking
it
the
third
bell
rang
i
ran
like
mad
and
jumped
into
the
first
carriage

ivan
alexyevitch
heaves
a
sigh
and
irresolutely
sits
down
facing
pyotr
petrovitch
he
is
visibly
excited
and
fidgets
as
though
he
were
sitting
on
thorns
where
are
you
travelling
to
pyotr
petrovitch
enquires
i
into
space
there
is
such
a
turmoil
in
my
head

go
where
fate
takes

counting
house

an
idiot
honour
bright
ha

on
my
honeymoon

son

my
dear
boy

after

wedding
congratulations
and
the
usual
questions
follow
well
you
are
a
fellow
laughs
pyotr
petrovitch
that
s
why
you
are
rigged
out
such
a
dandy
yes
indeed
to
complete
the
illusion
i
ve
even
sprinkled
myself
with
scent
i
am
over
my
ears
in
vanity
no
care
no
thought
nothing
but
a
sensation
of
something
or
other
deuce
knows
what
to
call
it
beatitude
or
something
i
ve
never
felt
so
grand
in
my
life
ivan
alexyevitch
shuts
his
eyes
and
waggles
his
head
i
m
revoltingly
happy
he
says
just
think
in
a
minute
i
shall
go
to
my
compartment
there
on
the
seat
near
the
window
is
sitting
a
being
who
is
so
to
say
devoted
to
you
with
her
whole
being
a
little
blonde
with
a
little
nose
little
fingers
my
little
darling
my
angel
my
little
poppet
phylloxera
of
my
soul
and
her
little
foot
good
god
a
little
foot
not
like
our
beetle
crushers
but
something
miniature
fairylike
allegorical
i
could
pick
it
up
and
eat
it
that
little
foot
oh
but
you
don
t
understand
you
re
a
materialist
of
course
you
begin
analyzing
at
once
and
one
thing
and
another
you
are
cold
hearted
bachelors
that
s
what
you
are
when
you
get
married
you
ll
think
of
me
where
s
ivan
alexyevitch
now
you
ll
say
yes
so
in
a
minute
i
m
going
to
my
compartment
there
she
is
waiting
for
me
with
impatience
in
joyful
anticipation
of
my
appearance
she
ll
have
a
smile
to
greet
me
i
sit
down
beside
her
and
take
her
chin
with
my
two
fingers
ivan
alexyevitch
waggles
his
head
and
goes
off
into
a
chuckle
of
delight
then
i
lay
my
noddle
on
her
shoulder
and
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
around
all
is
silence
you
know
poetic
twilight
i
could
embrace
the
whole
world
at
such
a
moment
pyotr
petrovitch
allow
me
to
embrace
you
delighted
i
m
sure
the
two
friends
embrace
while
the
passengers
laugh
in
chorus
and
the
happy
bridegroom
continues
and
to
complete
the
idiocy
or
as
the
novelists
say
to
complete
the
illusion
one
goes
to
the
refreshment
room
and
tosses
off
two
or
three
glasses
and
then
something
happens
in
your
head
and
your
heart
finer
than
you
can
read
of
in
a
fairy
tale
i
am
a
man
of
no
importance
but
i
feel
as
though
i
were
limitless
i
embrace
the
whole
world
the
passengers
looking
at
the
tipsy
and
blissful
bridegroom
are
infected
by
his
cheerfulness
and
no
longer
feel
sleepy
instead
of
one
listener
ivan
alexyevitch
has
now
an
audience
of
five
he
wriggles
and
splutters
gesticulates
and
prattles
on
without
ceasing
he
laughs
and
they
all
laugh
gentlemen
gentlemen
don
t
think
so
much
damn
all
this
analysis
if
you
want
a
drink
drink
no
need
to
philosophize
as
to
whether
it
s
bad
for
you
or
not
damn
all
this
philosophy
and
psychology
the
guard
walks
through
the
compartment
my
dear
fellow
the
bridegroom
addresses
him
when
you
pass
through
the
carriage
no
209
look
out
for
a
lady
in
a
grey
hat
with
a
white
bird
and
tell
her
i
m
here
yes
sir
only
there
isn
t
a
no
209
in
this
train
there
s
219
well
219
then
it
s
all
the
same
tell
that
lady
then
that
her
husband
is
all
right
ivan
alexyevitch
suddenly
clutches
his
head
and
groans
husband
lady
all
in
a
minute
husband
ha
ha
i
am
a
puppy
that
needs
thrashing
and
here
i
am
a
husband
ach
idiot
but
think
of
her
yesterday
she
was
a
little
girl
a
midget
it
s
simply
incredible
nowadays
it
really
seems
strange
to
see
a
happy
man
observes
one
of
the
passengers
one
as
soon
expects
to
see
a
white
elephant
yes
and
whose
fault
is
it
says
ivan
alexyevitch
stretching
his
long
legs
and
thrusting
out
his
feet
with
their
very
pointed
toes
if
you
are
not
happy
it
s
your
own
fault
yes
what
else
do
you
suppose
it
is
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
if
you
want
to
be
happy
you
will
be
but
you
don
t
want
to
be
you
obstinately
turn
away
from
happiness
why
what
next
how
do
you
make
that
out
very
simply
nature
has
ordained
that
at
a
certain
stage
in
his
life
man
should
love
when
that
time
comes
you
should
love
like
a
house
on
fire
but
you
won
t
heed
the
dictates
of
nature
you
keep
waiting
for
something
what
s
more
it
s
laid
down
by
law
that
the
normal
man
should
enter
upon
matrimony
there
s
no
happiness
without
marriage
when
the
propitious
moment
has
come
get
married
there
s
no
use
in
shilly
shallying
but
you
don
t
get
married
you
keep
waiting
for
something
then
the
scriptures
tell
us
that
wine
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
if
you
feel
happy
and
you
want
to
feel
better
still
then
go
to
the
refreshment
bar
and
have
a
drink
the
great
thing
is
not
to
be
too
clever
but
to
follow
the
beaten
track
the
beaten
track
is
a
grand
thing
you
say
that
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
how
the
devil
is
he
the
creator
of
it
when
a
toothache
or
an
ill
natured
mother
in
law
is
enough
to
scatter
his
happiness
to
the
winds
everything
depends
on
chance
if
we
had
an
accident
at
this
moment
you
d
sing
a
different
tune
stuff
and
nonsense
retorts
the
bridegroom
railway
accidents
only
happen
once
a
year
i
m
not
afraid
of
an
accident
for
there
is
no
reason
for
one
accidents
are
exceptional
confound
them
i
don
t
want
to
talk
of
them
oh
i
believe
we
re
stopping
at
a
station
where
are
you
going
now
asks
pyotr
petrovitch
to
moscow
or
somewhere
further
south
why
bless
you
how
could
i
go
somewhere
further
south
when
i
m
on
my
way
to
the
north
but
moscow
isn
t
in
the
north
i
know
that
but
we
re
on
our
way
to
petersburg
says
ivan
alexyevitch
we
are
going
to
moscow
mercy
on
us
to
moscow
what
do
you
mean
says
the
bridegroom
in
amazement
it
s
queer
for
what
station
did
you
take
your
ticket
for
petersburg
in
that
case
i
congratulate
you
you
ve
got
into
the
wrong
train
there
follows
a
minute
of
silence
the
bridegroom
gets
up
and
looks
blankly
round
the
company
yes
yes
pyotr
petrovitch
explains
you
must
have
jumped
into
the
wrong
train
at
bologoe
after
your
glass
of
brandy
you
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
down
train
ivan
alexyevitch
turns
pale
clutches
his
head
and
begins
pacing
rapidly
about
the
carriage
ach
idiot
that
i
am
he
says
in
indignation
scoundrel
the
devil
devour
me
whatever
am
i
to
do
now
why
my
wife
is
in
that
train
she
s
there
all
alone
expecting
me
consumed
by
anxiety
ach
i
m
a
motley
fool
the
bridegroom
falls
on
the
seat
and
writhes
as
though
someone
had
trodden
on
his
corns
i
am
un
unhappy
man
he
moans
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
do
there
there
the
passengers
try
to
console
him
it
s
all
right
you
must
telegraph
to
your
wife
and
try
to
change
into
the
petersburg
express
in
that
way
you
ll
overtake
her
the
petersburg
express
weeps
the
bridegroom
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
and
how
am
i
to
get
a
ticket
for
the
petersburg
express
all
my
money

with
my
wife
the
passengers
laughing
and
whispering
together
make
a
collection
and
furnish
the
happy
man
with
funds
a
troublesome
visitor
in
the
low
pitched
crooked
little
hut
of
artyom
the
forester
two
men
were
sitting
under
the
big
dark
ikon
artyom
himself
a
short
and
lean
peasant
with
a
wrinkled
aged
looking
face
and
a
little
beard
that
grew
out
of
his
neck
and
a
well
grown
young
man
in
a
new
crimson
shirt
and
big
wading
boots
who
had
been
out
hunting
and
come
in
for
the
night
they
were
sitting
on
a
bench
at
a
little
three
legged
table
on
which
a
tallow
candle
stuck
into
a
bottle
was
lazily
burning
outside
the
window
the
darkness
of
the
night
was
full
of
the
noisy
uproar
into
which
nature
usually
breaks
out
before
a
thunderstorm
the
wind
howled
angrily
and
the
bowed
trees
moaned
miserably
one
pane
of
the
window
had
been
pasted
up
with
paper
and
leaves
torn
off
by
the
wind
could
be
heard
pattering
against
the
paper
i
tell
you
what
good
christian
said
artyom
in
a
hoarse
little
tenor
half
whisper
staring
with
unbalinking
scared
looking
eyes
at
the
hunter
i
am
not
afraid
of
wolves
or
bears
or
wild
beasts
of
any
sort
but
i
am
afraid
of
man
you
can
save
yourself
from
beasts
with
a
gun
or
some
other
weapon
but
you
have
no
means
of
saving
yourself
from
a
wicked
man
to
be
sure
you
can
fire
at
a
beast
but
if
you
shoot
at
a
robber
you
will
have
to
answer
for
it
you
will
go
to
siberia
i
ve
been
forester
my
lad
for
thirty
years
and
i
couldn
t
tell
you
what
i
have
had
to
put
up
with
from
wicked
men
there
have
been
lots
and
lots
of
them
here
the
hut
s
on
a
track
it
s
a
cart
road
and
that
brings
them
the
devils
every
sort
of
ruffian
turns
up
and
without
taking
off
his
cap
or
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
bursts
straight
in
upon
one
with
give
us
some
bread
you
old
so
and
so
and
where
am
i
to
get
bread
for
him
what
claim
has
he
am
i
a
millionaire
to
feed
every
drunkard
that
passes
they
are
half
blind
with
spite
they
have
no
cross
on
them
the
devils
they
ll
give
you
a
clout
on
the
ear
and
not
think
twice
about
it
give
us
bread
well
one
gives
it
one
is
not
going
to
fight
with
them
the
idols
some
of
them
are
two
yards
across
the
shoulders
and
a
great
fist
as
big
as
your
boot
and
you
see
the
sort
of
figure
i
am
one
of
them
could
smash
me
with
his
little
finger
well
one
gives
him
bread
and
he
gobbles
it
up
and
stretches
out
full
length
across
the
hut
with
not
a
word
of
thanks
and
there
are
some
that
ask
for
money
tell
me
where
is
your
money
as
though
i
had
money
how
should
i
come
by
it
a
forester
and
no
money
laughed
the
hunter
you
get
wages
every
month
and
i
ll
be
bound
you
sell
timber
on
the
sly
artyom
took
a
timid
sideway
glance
at
his
visitor
and
twitched
his
beard
as
a
magpie
twitches
her
tail
you
are
still
young
to
say
a
thing
like
that
to
me
he
said
you
will
have
to
answer
to
god
for
those
words
whom
may
your
people
be
where
do
you
come
from
i
am
from
vyazovka
i
am
the
son
of
nefed
the
village
elder
you
have
gone
out
for
sport
with
your
gun
i
used
to
like
sport
too
when
i
was
young
h
m
ah
our
sins
are
grievous
said
artyom
with
a
yawn
it
s
a
sad
thing
there
are
few
good
folks
but
villains
and
murderers
no
end
god
have
mercy
upon
us
you
seem
to
be
frightened
of
me
too
come
what
next
what
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
for
i
see
i
understand
you
came
in
and
not
just
anyhow
but
you
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
you
bowed
all
decent
and
proper
i
understand
one
can
give
you
bread
i
am
a
widower
i
don
t
heat
the
stove
i
sold
the
samovar
i
am
too
poor
to
keep
meat
or
anything
else
but
bread
you
are
welcome
to
at
that
moment
something
began
growling
under
the
bench
the
growl
was
followed
by
a
hiss
artyom
started
drew
up
his
legs
and
looked
enquiringly
at
the
hunter
it
s
my
dog
worrying
your
cat
said
the
hunter
you
devils
he
shouted
under
the
bench
lie
down
you
ll
be
beaten
i
say
your
cat
s
thin
mate
she
is
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
she
is
old
it
is
time
she
was
dead
so
you
say
you
are
from
vyazovka
i
see
you
don
t
feed
her
though
she
s
a
cat
she
s
a
creature
every
breathing
thing
you
should
have
pity
on
her
you
are
a
queer
lot
in
vyazovka
artyom
went
on
as
though
not
listening
the
church
has
been
robbed
twice
in
one
year
to
think
that
there
are
such
wicked
men
so
they
fear
neither
man
nor
god
to
steal
what
is
the
lord
s
hanging
s
too
good
for
them
in
old
days
the
governors
used
to
have
such
rogues
flogged
however
you
punish
whether
it
is
with
flogging
or
anything
else
it
will
be
no
good
you
will
not
knock
the
wickedness
out
of
a
wicked
man
save
and
preserve
us
queen
of
heaven
the
forester
sighed
abruptly
save
us
from
all
enemies
and
evildoers
last
week
at
volovy
zaimishtchy
a
mower
struck
another
on
the
chest
with
his
scythe
he
killed
him
outright
and
what
was
it
all
about
god
bless
me
one
mower
came
out
of
the
tavern
drunk
the
other
met
him
drunk
too
the
young
man
who
had
been
listening
attentively
suddenly
started
and
his
face
grew
tense
as
he
listened
stay
he
said
interrupting
the
forester
i
fancy
someone
is
shouting
the
hunter
and
the
forester
fell
to
listening
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
through
the
noise
of
the
forest
they
could
hear
sounds
such
as
the
strained
ear
can
always
distinguish
in
every
storm
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
whether
people
were
calling
for
help
or
whether
the
wind
was
wailing
in
the
chimney
but
the
wind
tore
at
the
roof
tapped
at
the
paper
on
the
window
and
brought
a
distinct
shout
of
help
talk
of
your
murderers
said
the
hunter
turning
pale
and
getting
up
someone
is
being
robbed
lord
have
mercy
on
us
whispered
the
forester
and
he
too
turned
pale
and
got
up
the
hunter
looked
aimlessly
out
of
window
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hut
what
a
night
what
a
night
he
muttered
you
can
t
see
your
hand
before
your
face
the
very
time
for
a
robbery
do
you
hear
there
is
a
shout
again
the
forester
looked
at
the
ikon
and
from
the
ikon
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
hunter
and
sank
on
to
the
bench
collapsing
like
a
man
terrified
by
sudden
bad
news
good
christian
he
said
in
a
tearful
voice
you
might
go
into
the
passage
and
bolt
the
door
and
we
must
put
out
the
light
what
for
by
ill
luck
they
may
find
their
way
here
oh
our
sins
we
ought
to
be
going
and
you
talk
of
bolting
the
door
you
are
a
clever
one
are
you
coming
the
hunter
threw
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
picked
up
his
cap
get
ready
take
your
gun
hey
flerka
here
he
called
to
his
dog
flerka
a
dog
with
long
frayed
ears
a
mongrel
between
a
setter
and
a
house
dog
came
out
from
under
the
bench
he
stretched
himself
by
his
master
s
feet
and
wagged
his
tail
why
are
you
sitting
there
cried
the
hunter
to
the
forester
you
mean
to
say
you
are
not
going
where
to
help
how
can
i
said
the
forester
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
shuddering
all
over
i
can
t
bother
about
it
why
won
t
you
come
after
talking
of
such
dreadful
things
i
won
t
stir
a
step
into
the
darkness
bless
them
and
what
should
i
go
for
what
are
you
afraid
of
haven
t
you
got
a
gun
let
us
go
please
do
it
s
scaring
to
go
alone
it
will
be
more
cheerful
the
two
of
us
do
you
hear
there
was
a
shout
again
get
up
whatever
do
you
think
of
me
lad
wailed
the
forester
do
you
think
i
am
such
a
fool
to
go
straight
to
my
undoing
so
you
are
not
coming
the
forester
did
not
answer
the
dog
probably
hearing
a
human
cry
gave
a
plaintive
whine
are
you
coming
i
ask
you
cried
the
hunter
rolling
his
eyes
angrily
you
do
keep
on
upon
my
word
said
the
forester
with
annoyance
go
yourself
ugh
low
cur
growled
the
hunter
turning
towards
the
door
flerka
here
he
went
out
and
left
the
door
open
the
wind
flew
into
the
hut
the
flame
of
the
candle
flickered
uneasily
flared
up
and
went
out
as
he
bolted
the
door
after
the
hunter
the
forester
saw
the
puddles
in
the
track
the
nearest
pine
trees
and
the
retreating
figure
of
his
guest
lighted
up
by
a
flash
of
lightning
far
away
he
heard
the
rumble
of
thunder
holy
holy
holy
whispered
the
forester
making
haste
to
thrust
the
thick
bolt
into
the
great
iron
rings
what
weather
the
lord
has
sent
us
going
back
into
the
room
he
felt
his
way
to
the
stove
lay
down
and
covered
himself
from
head
to
foot
lying
under
the
sheepskin
and
listening
intently
he
could
no
longer
hear
the
human
cry
but
the
peals
of
thunder
kept
growing
louder
and
more
prolonged
he
could
hear
the
big
wind
lashed
raindrops
pattering
angrily
on
the
panes
and
on
the
paper
of
the
window
he
s
gone
on
a
fool
s
errand
he
thought
picturing
the
hunter
soaked
with
rain
and
stumbling
over
the
tree
stumps
i
bet
his
teeth
are
chattering
with
terror
not
more
than
ten
minutes
later
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
followed
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
who
s
there
cried
the
forester
it
s
i
he
heard
the
young
man
s
voice
unfasten
the
door
the
forester
clambered
down
from
the
stove
felt
for
the
candle
and
lighting
it
went
to
the
door
the
hunter
and
his
dog
were
drenched
to
the
skin
they
had
come
in
for
the
heaviest
of
the
downpour
and
now
the
water
ran
from
them
as
from
washed
clothes
before
they
have
been
wrung
out
what
was
it
asked
the
forester
a
peasant
woman
driving
in
a
cart
she
had
got
off
the
road
answered
the
young
man
struggling
with
his
breathlessness
she
was
caught
in
a
thicket
ah
the
silly
thing
she
was
frightened
then
well
did
you
put
her
on
the
road
i
don
t
care
to
talk
to
a
scoundrel
like
you
the
young
man
flung
his
wet
cap
on
the
bench
and
went
on
i
know
now
that
you
are
a
scoundrel
and
the
lowest
of
men
and
you
a
keeper
too
getting
a
salary
you
blackguard
the
forester
slunk
with
a
guilty
step
to
the
stove
cleared
his
throat
and
lay
down
the
young
man
sat
on
the
bench
thought
a
little
and
lay
down
on
it
full
length
not
long
afterwards
he
got
up
put
out
the
candle
and
lay
down
again
during
a
particularly
loud
clap
of
thunder
he
turned
over
spat
on
the
floor
and
growled
out
he
s
afraid
and
what
if
the
woman
were
being
murdered
whose
business
is
it
to
defend
her
and
he
an
old
man
too
and
a
christian
he
s
a
pig
and
nothing
else
the
forester
cleared
his
throat
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
somewhere
in
the
darkness
flerka
shook
his
wet
coat
vigorously
which
sent
drops
of
water
flying
about
all
over
the
room
so
you
wouldn
t
care
if
the
woman
were
murdered
the
hunter
went
on
well
strike
me
god
i
had
no
notion
you
were
that
sort
of
man
a
silence
followed
the
thunderstorm
was
by
now
over
and
the
thunder
came
from
far
away
but
it
was
still
raining
and
suppose
it
hadn
t
been
a
woman
but
you
shouting
help
said
the
hunter
breaking
the
silence
how
would
you
feel
you
beast
if
no
one
ran
to
your
aid
you
have
upset
me
with
your
meanness
plague
take
you
after
another
long
interval
the
hunter
said
you
must
have
money
to
be
afraid
of
people
a
man
who
is
poor
is
not
likely
to
be
afraid
for
those
words
you
will
answer
before
god
artyom
said
hoarsely
from
the
stove
i
have
no
money
i
dare
say
scoundrels
always
have
money
why
are
you
afraid
of
people
then
so
you
must
have
i
d
like
to
take
and
rob
you
for
spite
to
teach
you
a
lesson
artyom
slipped
noiselessly
from
the
stove
lighted
a
candle
and
sat
down
under
the
holy
image
he
was
pale
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
hunter
here
i
ll
rob
you
said
the
hunter
getting
up
what
do
you
think
about
it
fellows
like
you
want
a
lesson
tell
me
where
is
your
money
hidden
artyom
drew
his
legs
up
under
him
and
balinked
what
are
you
wriggling
for
where
is
your
money
hidden
have
you
lost
your
tongue
you
fool
why
don
t
you

the
young
man
jumped
up
and
went
up
to
the
forester
he
is
balinking
like
an
owl
well
give
me
your
money
or
i
will
shoot
you
with
my
gun
why
do
you
keep
on
at
me
squealed
the
forester
and
big
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
what
s
the
reason
of
it
god
sees
all
you
will
have
to
answer
for
every
word
you
say
to
god
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
ask
for
my
money
the
young
man
looked
at
artyom
s
tearful
face
frowned
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hut
then
angrily
clapped
his
cap
on
his
head
and
picked
up
his
gun
ugh
ugh
it
makes
me
sick
to
look
at
you
he
filtered
through
his
teeth
i
can
t
bear
the
sight
of
you
i
won
t
sleep
in
your
house
anyway
good
bye
hey
flerka
the
door
slammed
and
the
troublesome
visitor
went
out
with
his
dog
artyom
bolted
the
door
after
him
crossed
himself
and
lay
down
an
actor
s
end
shtchiptsov
the
heavy
father
and
good
hearted
simpleton
a
tall
and
thick
set
old
man
not
so
much
distinguished
by
his
talents
as
an
actor
as
by
his
exceptional
physical
strength
had
a
desperate
quarrel
with
the
manager
during
the
performance
and
just
when
the
storm
of
words
was
at
its
height
felt
as
though
something
had
snapped
in
his
chest
zhukov
the
manager
as
a
rule
began
at
the
end
of
every
heated
discussion
to
laugh
hysterically
and
to
fall
into
a
swoon
on
this
occasion
however
shtchiptsov
did
not
remain
for
this
climax
but
hurried
home
the
high
words
and
the
sensation
of
something
ruptured
in
his
chest
so
agitated
him
as
he
left
the
theatre
that
he
forgot
to
wash
off
his
paint
and
did
nothing
but
take
off
his
beard
when
he
reached
his
hotel
room
shtchiptsov
spent
a
long
time
pacing
up
and
down
then
sat
down
on
the
bed
propped
his
head
on
his
fists
and
sank
into
thought
he
sat
like
that
without
stirring
or
uttering
a
sound
till
two
o
clock
the
next
afternoon
when
sigaev
the
comic
man
walked
into
his
room
why
is
it
you
did
not
come
to
the
rehearsal
booby
ivanitch
the
comic
man
began
panting
and
filling
the
room
with
fumes
of
vodka
where
have
you
been
shtchiptsov
made
no
answer
but
simply
stared
at
the
comic
man
with
lustreless
eyes
under
which
there
were
smudges
of
paint
you
might
at
least
have
washed
your
phiz
sigaev
went
on
you

a
disgraceful
sight
have

boozing
or

ill
or

but
why

t
you

i
am
asking
you

you
ill
shtchiptsov
did
not
speak
in
spite
of
the
paint
on
his
face
the
comic
man
could
not
help
noticing
his
striking
pallor
the
drops
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
and
the
twitching
of
his
lips
his
hands
and
feet
were
trembling
too
and
the
whole
huge
figure
of
the
good
natured
simpleton
looked
somehow
crushed
and
flattened
the
comic
man
took
a
rapid
glance
round
the
room
but
saw
neither
bottle
nor
flask
nor
any
other
suspicious
vessel
i
say
mishutka
you
know
you
are
ill
he
said
in
a
flutter
strike
me
dead
you
are
ill

don
t
look
yourself
shtchiptsov
remained
silent
and
stared
disconsolately
at
the
floor
you
must
have
caught
cold
said
sigaev
taking
him
by
the
hand
oh

the
comic
man
fumbled
in
his
pockets
found
a
fifteen
kopeck
piece
and
ran
to
the
chemist
s
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
came
back
come

he
said
holding
the
bottle
to
the
heavy
father

mouth

straight
out
of
the
bottle
all
at
a
go
that

the
way
now
nibble
at
a
clove
that
your
very
soul
mayn
t
stink
of
the
filthy
stuff
the
comic
man
sat
a
little
longer
with
his
sick
friend
then
kissed
him
tenderly
and
went
away
towards
evening
the
jeune
premier
brama
glinsky
ran
in
to
see
shtchiptsov
the
gifted
actor
was
wearing
a
pair
of
prunella
boots
had
a
glove
on
his
left
hand
was
smoking
a
cigar
and
even
smelt
of
heliotrope
yet
nevertheless
he
strongly
suggested
a
traveller
cast
away
in
some
land
in
which
there
were
neither
baths
nor
laundresses
nor
tailors
i
hear
you
are
ill
he
said
to
shtchiptsov
twirling
round
on
his
heel
what
s
wrong
with
you
what
s
wrong
with
you
really
shtchiptsov
did
not
speak
nor
stir

t
talk
brama
glinsky
that
was
his
stage
name
in
his
passport
he
was
called
guskov
walked
away
to
the
window
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
fell
to
gazing
into
the
street
before
his
eyes
stretched
an
immense
waste
bounded
by
a
grey
fence
beside
which
ran
a
perfect
forest
of
last
year
s
burdocks
beyond
the
waste
ground
was
a
dark
deserted
factory
with
windows
boarded
up
a
belated
jackdaw
was
flying
round
the
chimney
this
dreary
lifeless
scene
was
beginning
to
be
veiled
in
the
dusk
of
evening
i
must
go
home
the
jeune
premier
heard
where
is
home
to
vyazma
to
my
home

a
thousand
miles

glinsky
drumming
on
the
window
pane
and

what

surplus
energy
upsets
you
you

tight
drink
you

whole
inside

very
thought
of

alarming
sashka
and
i
together

the
barrel
and
you
emptied
it
alone
and
even
sent
for
rum
afterwards
you
got
so
drunk
you
were
catching
devils
in
a
sack
and
pulled
a
lamp
post
up
by
the
roots
do
you
remember
then
you
went
off
to
beat
the
greeks
under
the
influence
of
these
agreeable
reminiscences
shtchiptsov
s
face
brightened
a
little
and
his
eyes
began
to
shine
and
do
you
remember
how
i
beat
savoikin
the
manager
he
muttered
raising
his
head
but
there
i
ve
beaten
thirty
three
managers
in
my
time
and
i
can
t
remember
how
many
smaller
fry
and
what
managers
they
were
men
who
would
not
permit
the
very
winds
to
touch
them
i

beaten
two
celebrated
authors
and
one
painter
what

a
horse
with
my
fists
and
at
taganrog
some
roughs
fell
upon
me
at
night
fifteen
of
them
i
took
off
their
caps
and
they
followed
me
begging

feel
it
if

could
go
to

a
pause
followed
after
a
silence
shtchiptsov
suddenly
jumped
up
and
seized
his
cap
he
looked
distraught
good
bye

am
going
to
vyazma
he
articulated
staggering
and

i
shall
go
on
foot
you
are
crazy
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
probably
because
the
same
thought
of
the
boundless
plains
the
unending
forests
and
swamps
struck
both
of
them
at
once
well
i
see
you
have
gone
off
your
head

jeune
premier
commented
i
ll
tell
you
what
old
man
first
thing
go
to
bed
then
drink
some
brandy
and
tea
to
put
you
into
a
sweat
and
some
castor
oil
of
course
stay
where
am
i
to
get
some
brandy
brama
glinsky
thought
a
minute
then
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
a
shopkeeper
called
madame
tsitrinnikov
to
try
and
get
it
from
her
on
tick
who
knows
perhaps
the
woman
would
feel
for
them
and
let
them
have
it
the
jeune
premier
went
off
and
half
an
hour
later
returned
with
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
some
castor
oil
shtchiptsov
was
sitting
motionless
as
before
on
the
bed
gazing
dumbly
at
the
floor
he
drank
the
castor
oil
offered
him
by
his
friend
like
an
automaton
with
no
consciousness
of
what
he
was
doing
like
an
automaton
he
sat
afterwards
at
the
table
and
drank
tea
and
brandy
mechanically
he
emptied
the
whole
bottle
and
let
the
jeune
premier
put
him
to
bed
the
latter
covered
him
up
with
a
quilt
and
an
overcoat
advised
him
to
get
into
a
perspiration
and
went
away
the
night
came
on
shtchiptsov
had
drunk
a
great
deal
of
brandy
but
he
did
not
sleep
he
lay
motionless
under
the
quilt
and
stared
at
the
dark
ceiling
then
seeing
the
moon
looking
in
at
the
window
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
ceiling
towards
the
companion
of
the
earth
and
lay
so
with
open
eyes
till
the
morning
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
zhukov
the
manager
ran
in
what
has
put
it
into
your
head
to
be
ill
my
angel
he
cackled
wrinkling
up
his
nose
aie
aie
a
man
with
your
physique
has
no
business
to
be
ill
for
shame
for
shame
do
you
know
i
was
quite
frightened
can
our
conversation
have
had
such
an
effect
on
him
i
wondered
my
dear
soul
i
hope
it
s
not
through
me
you
ve
fallen
ill
you
know
you
gave
me
as
good
er
and
besides
comrades
can
never
get
on
without
words
you
called
me
all
sorts
of
names
and
have
gone
at
me
with
your
fists
too
and
yet
i
am
fond
of
you
upon
my
soul
i
am
i
respect
you
and
am
fond
of
you
explain
my
angel
why
i
am
so
fond
of
you
you
are
neither
kith
nor
kin
nor
wife
but
as
soon
as
i
heard
you
had
fallen
ill
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
zhukov
spent
a
long
time
declaring
his
affection
then
fell
to
kissing
the
invalid
and
finally
was
so
overcome
by
his
feelings
that
he
began
laughing
hysterically
and
was
even
meaning
to
fall
into
a
swoon
but
probably
remembering
that
he
was
not
at
home
nor
at
the
theatre
put
off
the
swoon
to
a
more
convenient
opportunity
and
went
away
soon
after
him
adabashev
the
tragic
actor
a
dingy
short
sighted
individual
who
talked
through
his
nose
made
his
appearance
for
a
long
while
he
looked
at
shtchiptsov
for
a
long
while
he
pondered
and
at
last
he
made
a
discovery
do
you
know
what
mifa
he
said
pronouncing
through
his
nose
f
instead
of
sh
and
assuming
a
mysterious
expression
do
you
know
what
you
ought
to
have
a
dose
of
castor
oil
shtchiptsov
was
silent
he
remained
silent
too
a
little
later
as
the
tragic
actor
poured
the
loathsome
oil
into
his
mouth
two
hours
later
yevlampy
or
as
the
actors
for
some
reason
called
him
rigoletto
the
hairdresser
of
the
company
came
into
the
room
he
too
like
the
tragic
man
stared
at
shtchiptsov
for
a
long
time
then
sighed
like
a
steam
engine
and
slowly
and
deliberately
began
untying
a
parcel
he
had
brought
with
him
in
it
there
were
twenty
cups
and
several
little
flasks
you
should
have
sent
for
me
and
i
would
have
cupped
you
long
ago
he
said
tenderly
baring
shtchiptsov
s
chest
it
is
easy
to
neglect
illness
thereupon
rigoletto
stroked
the
broad
chest
of
the
heavy
father
and
covered
it
all
over
with
suction
cups
yes
he
said
as
after
this
operation
he
packed
up
his
paraphernalia
crimson
with
shtchiptsov
s
blood
you
should
have
sent
for
me
and
i
would
have
come
you
needn
t
trouble
about
payment
i
do
it
from
sympathy
where
are
you
to
get
the
money
if
that
idol
won
t
pay
you
now
please
take
these
drops
they
are
nice
drops
and
now
you
must
have
a
dose
of
this
castor
oil
it
s
the
real
thing
that
s
right
i
hope
it
will
do
you
good
well
now
good
bye
rigoletto
took
his
parcel
and
withdrew
pleased
that
he
had
been
of
assistance
to
a
fellow
creature
the
next
morning
sigaev
the
comic
man
going
in
to
see
shtchiptsov
found
him
in
a
terrible
condition
he
was
lying
under
his
coat
breathing
in
gasps
while
his
eyes
strayed
over
the
ceiling
in
his
hands
he
was
crushing
convulsively
the
crumpled
quilt
to
vyazma
he
whispered
when
he
saw
the
comic
man
to
vyazma
come
i
don
t
like
that
old
man
said
the
comic
man
flinging
up
his
hands
you
see
you
see
you
see
old
man
that
s
not
the
thing
excuse
me
but
it
s
positively
stupid
to
go
to
vyazma
my
god
to
vyazma
i
i
did
not
expect
it
of
you
the
comic
man
muttered
utterly
distracted
what
the
deuce
do
you
want
to
collapse
like
this
for
aie
aie
aie
that
s
not
the
thing
a
giant
as
tall
as
a
watch
tower
and
crying
is
it
the
thing
for
actors
to
cry
no
wife
nor
children
muttered
shtchiptsov
i
ought
not
to
have
gone
for
an
actor
but
have
stayed
at
vyazma
my
life
has
been
wasted
semyon
oh
to
be
in
vyazma
aie
aie
aie
that
s
not
the
thing
you
see
it
s
stupid
contemptible
indeed
recovering
his
composure
and
setting
his
feelings
in
order
sigaev
began
comforting
shtchiptsov
telling
him
untruly
that
his
comrades
had
decided
to
send
him
to
the
crimea
at
their
expense
and
so
on
but
the
sick
man
did
not
listen
and
kept
muttering
about
vyazma
at
last
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
comic
man
began
talking
about
vyazma
himself
to
comfort
the
invalid
it
s
a
fine
town
he
said
soothingly
a
capital
town
old
man
it
s
famous
for
its
cakes
the
cakes
are
classical
but
between
ourselves
h
m
they
are
a
bit
groggy
for
a
whole
week
after
eating
them
i
was
h
m
but
what
is
fine
there
is
the
merchants
they
are
something
like
merchants
when
they
treat
you
they
do
treat
you
the
comic
man
talked
while
shtchiptsov
listened
in
silence
and
nodded
his
head
approvingly
towards
evening
he
died
the
schoolmaster
fyodor
lukitch
sysoev
the
master
of
the
factory
school
maintained
at
the
expense
of
the
firm
of
kulikin
was
getting
ready
for
the
annual
dinner
every
year
after
the
school
examination
the
board
of
managers
gave
a
dinner
at
which
the
inspector
of
elementary
schools
all
who
had
conducted
the
examinations
and
all
the
managers
and
foremen
of
the
factory
were
present
in
spite
of
their
official
character
these
dinners
were
always
good
and
lively
and
the
guests
sat
a
long
time
over
them
forgetting
distinctions
of
rank
and
recalling
only
their
meritorious
labours
they
ate
till
they
were
full
drank
amicably
chattered
till
they
were
all
hoarse
and
parted
late
in
the
evening
deafening
the
whole
factory
settlement
with
their
singing
and
the
sound
of
their
kisses
of
such
dinners
sysoev
had
taken
part
in
thirteen
as
he
had
been
that
number
of
years
master
of
the
factory
school
now
getting
ready
for
the
fourteenth
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
look
as
festive
and
correct
as
possible
he
had
spent
a
whole
hour
brushing
his
new
black
suit
and
spent
almost
as
long
in
front
of
a
looking
glass
while
he
put
on
a
fashionable
shirt
the
studs
would
not
go
into
the
button
holes
and
this
circumstance
called
forth
a
perfect
storm
of
complaints
threats
and
reproaches
addressed
to
his
wife
his
poor
wife
bustling
round
him
wore
herself
out
with
her
efforts
and
indeed
he
too
was
exhausted
in
the
end
when
his
polished
boots
were
brought
him
from
the
kitchen
he
had
not
strength
to
pull
them
on
he
had
to
lie
down
and
have
a
drink
of
water
how
weak
you
have
grown
sighed
his
wife
you
ought
not
to
go
to
this
dinner
at
all
no
advice
please
the
schoolmaster
cut
her
short
angrily
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
for
he
had
been
much
displeased
with
the
recent
examinations
the
examinations
had
gone
off
splendidly
all
the
boys
of
the
senior
division
had
gained
certificates
and
prizes
both
the
managers
of
the
factory
and
the
government
officials
were
pleased
with
the
results
but
that
was
not
enough
for
the
schoolmaster
he
was
vexed
that
babkin
a
boy
who
never
made
a
mistake
in
writing
had
made
three
mistakes
in
the
dictation
sergeyev
another
boy
had
been
so
excited
that
he
could
not
remember
seventeen
times
thirteen
the
inspector
a
young
and
inexperienced
man
had
chosen
a
difficult
article
for
dictation
and
lyapunov
the
master
of
a
neighbouring
school
whom
the
inspector
had
asked
to
dictate
had
not
behaved
like
a
good
comrade
but
in
dictating
had
as
it
were
swallowed
the
words
and
had
not
pronounced
them
as
written
after
pulling
on
his
boots
with
the
assistance
of
his
wife
and
looking
at
himself
once
more
in
the
looking
glass
the
schoolmaster
took
his
gnarled
stick
and
set
off
for
the
dinner
just
before
the
factory
manager
s
house
where
the
festivity
was
to
take
place
he
had
a
little
mishap
he
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
he
was
so
shaken
by
it
that
the
cap
flew
off
his
head
and
the
stick
dropped
out
of
his
hand
and
when
the
school
inspector
and
the
teachers
hearing
his
cough
ran
out
of
the
house
he
was
sitting
on
the
bottom
step
bathed
in
perspiration
fyodor
lukitch
is
that
you
said
the
inspector
surprised
you
have
come
why
not
you
ought
to
be
at
home
my
dear
fellow
you
are
not
at
all
well
to
day
i
am
just
the
same
to
day
as
i
was
yesterday
and
if
my
presence
is
not
agreeable
to
you
i
can
go
back
oh
fyodor
lukitch
you
must
not
talk
like
that
please
come
in
why
the
function
is
really
in
your
honour
not
ours
and
we
are
delighted
to
see
you
of
course
we
are
within
everything
was
ready
for
the
banquet
in
the
big
dining
room
adorned
with
german
oleographs
and
smelling
of
geraniums
and
varnish
there
were
two
tables
a
larger
one
for
the
dinner
and
a
smaller
one
for
the
hors
d
oeuvres
the
hot
light
of
midday
faintly
percolated
through
the
lowered
blinds
the
twilight
of
the
room
the
swiss
views
on
the
blinds
the
geraniums
the
thin
slices
of
sausage
on
the
plates
all
had
a
na
ve
girlishly
sentimental
air
and
it
was
all
in
keeping
with
the
master
of
the
house
a
good
natured
little
german
with
a
round
little
stomach
and
affectionate
oily
little
eyes
adolf
andreyitch
bruni
that
was
his
name
was
bustling
round
the
table
of
hors
d
oeuvres
as
zealously
as
though
it
were
a
house
on
fire
filling
up
the
wine
glasses
loading
the
plates
and
trying
in
every
way
to
please
to
amuse
and
to
show
his
friendly
feelings
he
clapped
people
on
the
shoulder
looked
into
their
eyes
chuckled
rubbed
his
hands
in
fact
was
as
ingratiating
as
a
friendly
dog
whom
do
i
behold
fyodor
lukitch
he
said
in
a
jerky
voice
on
seeing
sysoev
how
delightful
you
have
come
in
spite
of
your
illness
gentlemen
let
me
congratulate
you
fyodor
lukitch
has
come
the
school
teachers
were
already
crowding
round
the
table
and
eating
the
hors
d
oeuvres
sysoev
frowned
he
was
displeased
that
his
colleagues
had
begun
to
eat
and
drink
without
waiting
for
him
he
noticed
among
them
lyapunov
the
man
who
had
dictated
at
the
examination
and
going
up
to
him
began
it
was
not
acting
like
a
comrade
no
indeed
gentlemanly
people
don
t
dictate
like
that
good
lord
you
are
still
harping
on
it
said
lyapunov
and
he
frowned
aren
t
you
sick
of
it
yes
still
harping
on
it
my
babkin
has
never
made
mistakes
i
know
why
you
dictated
like
that
you
simply
wanted
my
pupils
to
be
floored
so
that
your
school
might
seem
better
than
mine
i
know
all
about
it
why
are
you
trying
to
get
up
a
quarrel
lyapunov
snarled
why
the
devil
do
you
pester
me
come
gentlemen
interposed
the
inspector
making
a
woebegone
face
is
it
worth
while
to
get
so
heated
over
a
trifle
three
mistakes
not
one
mistake
does
it
matter
yes
it
does
matter
babkin
has
never
made
mistakes
he
won
t
leave
off
lyapunov
went
on
snorting
angrily
he
takes
advantage
of
his
position
as
an
invalid
and
worries
us
all
to
death
well
sir
i
am
not
going
to
consider
your
being
ill
let
my
illness
alone
cried
sysoev
angrily
what
is
it
to
do
with
you
they
all
keep
repeating
it
at
me
illness
illness
illness
as
though
i
need
your
sympathy
besides
where
have
you
picked
up
the
notion
that
i
am
ill
i
was
ill
before
the
examinations
that
s
true
but
now
i
have
completely
recovered
there
is
nothing
left
of
it
but
weakness
you
have
regained
your
health
well
thank
god
said
the
scripture
teacher
father
nikolay
a
young
priest
in
a
foppish
cinnamon
coloured
cassock
and
trousers
outside
his
boots
you
ought
to
rejoice
but
you
are
irritable
and
so
on
you
are
a
nice
one
too
sysoev
interrupted
him
questions
ought
to
be
straightforward
clear
but
you
kept
asking
riddles
that
s
not
the
thing
to
do
by
combined
efforts
they
succeeded
in
soothing
him
and
making
him
sit
down
to
the
table
he
was
a
long
time
making
up
his
mind
what
to
drink
and
pulling
a
wry
face
drank
a
wine
glass
of
some
green
liqueur
then
he
drew
a
bit
of
pie
towards
him
and
sulkily
picked
out
of
the
inside
an
egg
with
onion
on
it
at
the
first
mouthful
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
no
salt
in
it
he
sprinkled
salt
on
it
and
at
once
pushed
it
away
as
the
pie
was
too
salt
at
dinner
sysoev
was
seated
between
the
inspector
and
bruni
after
the
first
course
the
toasts
began
according
to
the
old
established
custom
i
consider
it
my
agreeable
duty
the
inspector
began
to
propose
a
vote
of
thanks
to
the
absent
school
wardens
daniel
petrovitch
and
and
and
and
ivan
petrovitch
bruni
prompted
him
and
ivan
petrovitch
kulikin
who
grudge
no
expense
for
the
school
and
i
propose
to
drink
their
health
for
my
part
said
bruni
jumping
up
as
though
he
had
been
stung
i
propose
a
toast
to
the
health
of
the
honoured
inspector
of
elementary
schools
pavel
gennadievitch
nadarov
chairs
were
pushed
back
faces
beamed
with
smiles
and
the
usual
cblinking
of
glasses
began
the
third
toast
always
fell
to
sysoev
and
on
this
occasion
too
he
got
up
and
began
to
speak
looking
grave
and
clearing
his
throat
he
first
of
all
announced
that
he
had
not
the
gift
of
eloquence
and
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
make
a
speech
further
he
said
that
during
the
fourteen
years
that
he
had
been
schoolmaster
there
had
been
many
intrigues
many
underhand
attacks
and
even
secret
reports
on
him
to
the
authorities
and
that
he
knew
his
enemies
and
those
who
had
informed
against
him
and
he
would
not
mention
their
names
for
fear
of
spoiling
somebody
s
appetite
that
in
spite
of
these
intrigues
the
kulikin
school
held
the
foremost
place
in
the
whole
province
not
only
from
a
moral
but
also
from
a
material
point
of
view
everywhere
else
he
said
schoolmasters
get
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
roubles
while
i
get
five
hundred
and
moreover
my
house
has
been
redecorated
and
even
furnished
at
the
expense
of
the
firm
and
this
year
all
the
walls
have
been
repapered
further
the
schoolmaster
enlarged
on
the
liberality
with
which
the
pupils
were
provided
with
writing
materials
in
the
factory
schools
as
compared
with
the
zemstvo
and
government
schools
and
for
all
this
the
school
was
indebted
in
his
opinion
not
to
the
heads
of
the
firm
who
lived
abroad
and
scarcely
knew
of
its
existence
but
to
a
man
who
in
spite
of
his
german
origin
and
lutheran
faith
was
a
russian
at
heart
sysoev
spoke
at
length
with
pauses
to
get
his
breath
and
with
pretensions
to
rhetoric
and
his
speech
was
boring
and
unpleasant
he
several
times
referred
to
certain
enemies
of
his
tried
to
drop
hints
repeated
himself
coughed
and
flourished
his
fingers
unbecomingly
at
last
he
was
exhausted
and
in
a
perspiration
and
he
began
talking
jerkily
in
a
low
voice
as
though
to
himself
and
finished
his
speech
not
quite
coherently
and
so
i
propose
the
health
of
bruni
that
is
adolf
andreyitch
who
is
here
among
us
generally
speaking
you
understand
when
he
finished
everyone
gave
a
faint
sigh
as
though
someone
had
sprinkled
cold
water
and
cleared
the
air
bruni
alone
apparently
had
no
unpleasant
feeling
beaming
and
rolling
his
sentimental
eyes
the
german
shook
sysoev
s
hand
with
feeling
and
was
again
as
friendly
as
a
dog
oh
i
thank
you
he
said
with
an
emphasis
on
the
oh
laying
his
left
hand
on
his
heart
i
am
very
happy
that
you
understand
me
i
with
my
whole
heart
wish
you
all
things
good
but
i
ought
only
to
observe
you
exaggerate
my
importance
the
school
owes
its
flourishing
condition
only
to
you
my
honoured
friend
fyodor
lukitch
but
for
you
it
would
be
in
no
way
distinguished
from
other
schools
you
think
the
german
is
paying
a
compliment
the
german
is
saying
something
polite
ha
ha
no
my
dear
fyodor
lukitch
i
am
an
honest
man
and
never
make
complimentary
speeches
if
we
pay
you
five
hundred
roubles
a
year
it
is
because
you
are
valued
by
us
isn
t
that
so
gentlemen
what
i
say
is
true
isn
t
it
we
should
not
pay
anyone
else
so
much
why
a
good
school
is
an
honour
to
the
factory
i
must
sincerely
own
that
your
school
is
really
exceptional
said
the
inspector
don
t
think
this
is
flattery
anyway
i
have
never
come
across
another
like
it
in
my
life
as
i
sat
at
the
examination
i
was
full
of
admiration
wonderful
children
they
know
a
great
deal
and
answer
brightly
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
somehow
special
unconstrained
sincere
one
can
see
that
they
love
you
fyodor
lukitch
you
are
a
schoolmaster
to
the
marrow
of
your
bones
you
must
have
been
born
a
teacher
you
have
all
the
gifts
innate
vocation
long
experience
and
love
for
your
work
it
s
simply
amazing
considering
the
weak
state
of
your
health
what
energy
what
understanding
what
perseverance
do
you
understand
what
confidence
you
have
some
one
in
the
school
committee
said
truly
that
you
were
a
poet
in
your
work
yes
a
poet
you
are
and
all
present
at
the
dinner
began
as
one
man
talking
of
sysoev
s
extraordinary
talent
and
as
though
a
dam
had
been
burst
there
followed
a
flood
of
sincere
enthusiastic
words
such
as
men
do
not
utter
when
they
are
restrained
by
prudent
and
cautious
sobriety
sysoev
s
speech
and
his
intolerable
temper
and
the
horrid
spiteful
expression
on
his
face
were
all
forgotten
everyone
talked
freely
even
the
shy
and
silent
new
teachers
poverty
stricken
down
trodden
youths
who
never
spoke
to
the
inspector
without
addressing
him
as
your
honour
it
was
clear
that
in
his
own
circle
sysoev
was
a
person
of
consequence
having
been
accustomed
to
success
and
praise
for
the
fourteen
years
that
he
had
been
schoolmaster
he
listened
with
indifference
to
the
noisy
enthusiasm
of
his
admirers
it
was
bruni
who
drank
in
the
praise
instead
of
the
schoolmaster
the
german
caught
every
word
beamed
clapped
his
hands
and
flushed
modestly
as
though
the
praise
referred
not
to
the
schoolmaster
but
to
him
bravo
bravo
he
shouted
that
s
true
you
have
grasped
my
meaning
excellent
he
looked
into
the
schoolmaster
s
eyes
as
though
he
wanted
to
share
his
bliss
with
him
at
last
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
he
leapt
up
and
overpowering
all
the
other
voices
with
his
shrill
little
tenor
shouted
gentlemen
allow
me
to
speak
sh
h
to
all
you
say
i
can
make
only
one
reply
the
management
of
the
factory
will
not
be
forgetful
of
what
it
owes
to
fyodor
lukitch
all
were
silent
sysoev
raised
his
eyes
to
the
german
s
rosy
face
we
know
how
to
appreciate
it
bruni
went
on
dropping
his
voice
in
response
to
your
words
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
fyodor
lukitch
s
family
will
be
provided
for
and
that
a
sum
of
money
was
placed
in
the
bank
a
month
ago
for
that
object
sysoev
looked
enquiringly
at
the
german
at
his
colleagues
as
though
unable
to
understand
why
his
family
should
be
provided
for
and
not
he
himself
and
at
once
on
all
the
faces
in
all
the
motionless
eyes
bent
upon
him
he
read
not
the
sympathy
not
the
commiseration
which
he
could
not
endure
but
something
else
something
soft
tender
but
at
the
same
time
intensely
sinister
like
a
terrible
truth
something
which
in
one
instant
turned
him
cold
all
over
and
filled
his
soul
with
unutterable
despair
with
a
pale
distorted
face
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
clutched
at
his
head
for
a
quarter
of
a
minute
he
stood
like
that
stared
with
horror
at
a
fixed
point
before
him
as
though
he
saw
the
swiftly
coming
death
of
which
bruni
was
speaking
then
sat
down
and
burst
into
tears
come
come
what
is
it
he
heard
agitated
voices
saying
water
drink
a
little
water
a
short
time
passed
and
the
schoolmaster
grew
calmer
but
the
party
did
not
recover
their
previous
liveliness
the
dinner
ended
in
gloomy
silence
and
much
earlier
than
on
previous
occasions
when
he
got
home
sysoev
first
of
all
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
of
course
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
blubber
like
that
he
thought
looking
at
his
sunken
cheeks
and
his
eyes
with
dark
rings
under
them
my
face
is
a
much
better
colour
to
day
than
yesterday
i
am
suffering
from
anemia
and
catarrh
of
the
stomach
and
my
cough
is
only
a
stomach
cough
reassured
he
slowly
began
undressing
and
spent
a
long
time
brushing
his
new
black
suit
then
carefully
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
the
chest
of
drawers
then
he
went
up
to
the
table
where
there
lay
a
pile
of
his
pupils
exercise
books
and
picking
out
babkin
s
sat
down
and
fell
to
contemplating
the
beautiful
childish
handwriting
and
meantime
while
he
was
examining
the
exercise
books
the
district
doctor
was
sitting
in
the
next
room
and
telling
his
wife
in
a
whisper
that
a
man
ought
not
to
have
been
allowed
to
go
out
to
dinner
who
had
not
in
all
probability
more
than
a
week
to
live
enemies
between
nine
and
ten
on
a
dark
september
evening
the
only
son
of
the
district
doctor
kirilov
a
child
of
six
called
andrey
died
of
diphtheria
just
as
the
doctor
s
wife
sank
on
her
knees
by
the
dead
child
s
bedside
and
was
overwhelmed
by
the
first
rush
of
despair
there
came
a
sharp
ring
at
the
bell
in
the
entry
all
the
servants
had
been
sent
out
of
the
house
that
morning
on
account
of
the
diphtheria
kirilov
went
to
open
the
door
just
as
he
was
without
his
coat
on
with
his
waistcoat
unbuttoned
without
wiping
his
wet
face
or
his
hands
which
were
scalded
with
carbolic
it
was
dark
in
the
entry
and
nothing
could
be
distinguished
in
the
man
who
came
in
but
medium
height
a
white
scarf
and
a
large
extremely
pale
face
so
pale
that
its
entrance
seemed
to
make
the
passage
lighter
is
the
doctor
at
home
the
newcomer
asked
quickly
i
am
at
home
answered
kirilov
what
do
you
want
oh
it
s
you
i
am
very
glad
said
the
stranger
in
a
tone
of
relief
and
he
began
feeling
in
the
dark
for
the
doctor
s
hand
found
it
and
squeezed
it
tightly
in
his
own
i
am
very
very
glad
we
are
acquainted
my
name
is
abogin
and
i
had
the
honour
of
meeting
you
in
the
summer
at
gnutchev
s
i
am
very
glad
i
have
found
you
at
home
for
god
s
sake
don
t
refuse
to
come
back
with
me
at
once
my
wife
has
been
taken
dangerously
ill
and
the
carriage
is
waiting
from
the
voice
and
gestures
of
the
speaker
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
like
a
man
terrified
by
a
house
on
fire
or
a
mad
dog
he
could
hardly
restrain
his
rapid
breathing
and
spoke
quickly
in
a
shaking
voice
and
there
was
a
note
of
unaffected
sincerity
and
childish
alarm
in
his
voice
as
people
always
do
who
are
frightened
and
overwhelmed
he
spoke
in
brief
jerky
sentences
and
uttered
a
great
many
unnecessary
irrelevant
words
i
was
afraid
i
might
not
find
you
in
he
went
on
i
was
in
a
perfect
agony
as
i
drove
here
put
on
your
things
and
let
us
go
for
god
s
sake
this
is
how
it
happened
alexandr
semyonovitch
paptchinsky
whom
you
know
came
to
see
me
we
talked
a
little
and
then
we
sat
down
to
tea
suddenly
my
wife
cried
out
clutched
at
her
heart
and
fell
back
on
her
chair
we
carried
her
to
bed
and
and
i
rubbed
her
forehead
with
ammonia
and
sprinkled
her
with
water
she
lay
as
though
she
were
dead
i
am
afraid
it
is
aneurism
come
along
her
father
died
of
aneurism
kirilov
listened
and
said
nothing
as
though
he
did
not
understand
russian
when
abogin
mentioned
again
paptchinsky
and
his
wife
s
father
and
once
more
began
feeling
in
the
dark
for
his
hand
the
doctor
shook
his
head
and
said
apathetically
dragging
out
each
word
excuse
me
i
can
not
come
my
son
died
five
minutes
ago
is
it
possible
whispered
abogin
stepping
back
a
pace
my
god
at
what
an
unlucky
moment
i
have
come
a
wonderfully
unhappy
day
wonderfully
what
a
coincidence
it
s
as
though
it
were
on
purpose
abogin
took
hold
of
the
door
handle
and
bowed
his
head
he
was
evidently
hesitating
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
whether
to
go
away
or
to
continue
entreating
the
doctor
listen
he
said
fervently
catching
hold
of
kirilov
s
sleeve
i
well
understand
your
position
god
is
my
witness
that
i
am
ashamed
of
attempting
at
such
a
moment
to
intrude
on
your
attention
but
what
am
i
to
do
only
think
to
whom
can
i
go
there
is
no
other
doctor
here
you
know
for
god
s
sake
come
i
am
not
asking
you
for
myself
i
am
not
the
patient
a
silence
followed
kirilov
turned
his
back
on
abogin
stood
still
a
moment
and
slowly
walked
into
the
drawing
room
judging
from
his
unsteady
mechanical
step
from
the
attention
with
which
he
set
straight
the
fluffy
shade
on
the
unlighted
lamp
in
the
drawing
room
and
glanced
into
a
thick
book
lying
on
the
table
at
that
instant
he
had
no
intention
no
desire
was
thinking
of
nothing
and
most
likely
did
not
remember
that
there
was
a
stranger
in
the
entry
the
twilight
and
stillness
of
the
drawing
room
seemed
to
increase
his
numbness
going
out
of
the
drawing
room
into
his
study
he
raised
his
right
foot
higher
than
was
necessary
and
felt
for
the
doorposts
with
his
hands
and
as
he
did
so
there
was
an
air
of
perplexity
about
his
whole
figure
as
though
he
were
in
somebody
else
s
house
or
were
drunk
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
were
now
abandoning
himself
with
surprise
to
the
new
sensation
a
broad
streak
of
light
stretched
across
the
bookcase
on
one
wall
of
the
study
this
light
came
together
with
the
close
heavy
smell
of
carbolic
and
ether
from
the
door
into
the
bedroom
which
stood
a
little
way
open
the
doctor
sank
into
a
low
chair
in
front
of
the
table
for
a
minute
he
stared
drowsily
at
his
books
which
lay
with
the
light
on
them
then
got
up
and
went
into
the
bedroom
here
in
the
bedroom
reigned
a
dead
silence
everything
to
the
smallest
detail
was
eloquent
of
the
storm
that
had
been
passed
through
of
exhaustion
and
everything
was
at
rest
a
candle
standing
among
a
crowd
of
bottles
boxes
and
pots
on
a
stool
and
a
big
lamp
on
the
chest
of
drawers
threw
a
brilliant
light
over
all
the
room
on
the
bed
under
the
window
lay
a
boy
with
open
eyes
and
a
look
of
wonder
on
his
face
he
did
not
move
but
his
open
eyes
seemed
every
moment
growing
darker
and
sinking
further
into
his
head
the
mother
was
kneeling
by
the
bed
with
her
arms
on
his
body
and
her
head
hidden
in
the
bedclothes
like
the
child
she
did
not
stir
but
what
throbbing
life
was
suggested
in
the
curves
of
her
body
and
in
her
arms
she
leaned
against
the
bed
with
all
her
being
pressing
against
it
greedily
with
all
her
might
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
disturbing
the
peaceful
and
comfortable
attitude
she
had
found
at
last
for
her
exhausted
body
the
bedclothes
the
rags
and
bowls
the
splashes
of
water
on
the
floor
the
little
paint
brushes
and
spoons
thrown
down
here
and
there
the
white
bottle
of
lime
water
the
very
air
heavy
and
stifling
were
all
hushed
and
seemed
plunged
in
repose
the
doctor
stopped
close
to
his
wife
thrust
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
slanting
his
head
on
one
side
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
son
his
face
bore
an
expression
of
indifference
and
only
from
the
drops
that
glittered
on
his
beard
it
could
be
seen
that
he
had
just
been
crying
that
repellent
horror
which
is
thought
of
when
we
speak
of
death
was
absent
from
the
room
in
the
numbness
of
everything
in
the
mother
s
attitude
in
the
indifference
on
the
doctor
s
face
there
was
something
that
attracted
and
touched
the
heart
that
subtle
almost
elusive
beauty
of
human
sorrow
which
men
will
not
for
a
long
time
learn
to
understand
and
describe
and
which
it
seems
only
music
can
convey
there
was
a
feeling
of
beauty
too
in
the
austere
stillness
kirilov
and
his
wife
were
silent
and
not
weeping
as
though
besides
the
bitterness
of
their
loss
they
were
conscious
too
of
all
the
tragedy
of
their
position
just
as
once
their
youth
had
passed
away
so
now
together
with
this
boy
their
right
to
have
children
had
gone
for
ever
to
all
eternity
the
doctor
was
forty
four
his
hair
was
grey
and
he
looked
like
an
old
man
his
faded
and
invalid
wife
was
thirty
five
andrey
was
not
merely
the
only
child
but
also
the
last
child
in
contrast
to
his
wife
the
doctor
belonged
to
the
class
of
people
who
at
times
of
spiritual
suffering
feel
a
craving
for
movement
after
standing
for
five
minutes
by
his
wife
he
walked
raising
his
right
foot
high
from
the
bedroom
into
a
little
room
which
was
half
filled
up
by
a
big
sofa
from
there
he
went
into
the
kitchen
after
wandering
by
the
stove
and
the
cook
s
bed
he
bent
down
and
went
by
a
little
door
into
the
passage
there
he
saw
again
the
white
scarf
and
the
white
face
at
last
sighed
abogin
reaching
towards
the
door
handle
let
us
go
please
the
doctor
started
glanced
at
him
and
remembered
why
i
have
told
you
already
that
i
can
t
go
he
said
growing
more
animated
how
strange
doctor
i
am
not
a
stone
i
fully
understand
your
position
i
feel
for
you
abogin
said
in
an
imploring
voice
laying
his
hand
on
his
scarf
but
i
am
not
asking
you
for
myself
my
wife
is
dying
if
you
had
heard
that
cry
if
you
had
seen
her
face
you
would
understand
my
pertinacity
my
god
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
get
ready
doctor
time
is
precious
let
us
go
i
entreat
you
i
can
not
go
said
kirilov
emphatically
and
he
took
a
step
into
the
drawing
room
abogin
followed
him
and
caught
hold
of
his
sleeve
you
are
in
sorrow
i
understand
but
i
m
not
asking
you
to
a
case
of
toothache
or
to
a
consultation
but
to
save
a
human
life
he
went
on
entreating
like
a
beggar
life
comes
before
any
personal
sorrow
come
i
ask
for
courage
for
heroism
for
the
love
of
humanity
humanity
that
cuts
both
ways
kirilov
said
irritably
in
the
name
of
humanity
i
beg
you
not
to
take
me
and
how
queer
it
is
really
i
can
hardly
stand
and
you
talk
to
me
about
humanity
i
am
fit
for
nothing
just
now
nothing
will
induce
me
to
go
and
i
can
t
leave
my
wife
alone
no
no
kirilov
waved
his
hands
and
staggered
back
and
and
don
t
ask
me
he
went
on
in
a
tone
of
alarm
excuse
me
by
no
xiii
of
the
regulations
i
am
obliged
to
go
and
you
have
the
right
to
drag
me
by
my
collar
drag
me
if
you
like
but
i
am
not
fit
i
can
t
even
speak
excuse
me
there
is
no
need
to
take
that
tone
to
me
doctor
said
abogin
again
taking
the
doctor
by
his
sleeve
what
do
i
care
about
no
xiii
to
force
you
against
your
will
i
have
no
right
whatever
if
you
will
come
if
you
will
not
god
forgive
you
but
i
am
not
appealing
to
your
will
but
to
your
feelings
a
young
woman
is
dying
you
were
just
speaking
of
the
death
of
your
son
who
should
understand
my
horror
if
not
you
abogin
s
voice
quivered
with
emotion
that
quiver
and
his
tone
were
far
more
persuasive
than
his
words
abogin
was
sincere
but
it
was
remarkable
that
whatever
he
said
his
words
sounded
stilted
soulless
and
inappropriately
flowery
and
even
seemed
an
outrage
on
the
atmosphere
of
the
doctor
s
home
and
on
the
woman
who
was
somewhere
dying
he
felt
this
himself
and
so
afraid
of
not
being
understood
did
his
utmost
to
put
softness
and
tenderness
into
his
voice
so
that
the
sincerity
of
his
tone
might
prevail
if
his
words
did
not
as
a
rule
however
fine
and
deep
a
phrase
may
be
it
only
affects
the
indifferent
and
can
not
fully
satisfy
those
who
are
happy
or
unhappy
that
is
why
dumbness
is
most
often
the
highest
expression
of
happiness
or
unhappiness
lovers
understand
each
other
better
when
they
are
silent
and
a
fervent
passionate
speech
delivered
by
the
grave
only
touches
outsiders
while
to
the
widow
and
children
of
the
dead
man
it
seems
cold
and
trivial
kirilov
stood
in
silence
when
abogin
uttered
a
few
more
phrases
concerning
the
noble
calling
of
a
doctor
self
sacrifice
and
so
on
the
doctor
asked
sullenly
is
it
far
something
like
eight
or
nine
miles
i
have
capital
horses
doctor
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
will
get
you
there
and
back
in
an
hour
only
one
hour
these
words
had
more
effect
on
kirilov
than
the
appeals
to
humanity
or
the
noble
calling
of
the
doctor
he
thought
a
moment
and
said
with
a
sigh
very
well
let
us
go
he
went
rapidly
with
a
more
certain
step
to
his
study
and
afterwards
came
back
in
a
long
frock
coat
abogin
greatly
relieved
fidgeted
round
him
and
scraped
with
his
feet
as
he
helped
him
on
with
his
overcoat
and
went
out
of
the
house
with
him
it
was
dark
out
of
doors
though
lighter
than
in
the
entry
the
tall
stooping
figure
of
the
doctor
with
his
long
narrow
beard
and
aquiline
nose
stood
out
distinctly
in
the
darkness
abogin
s
big
head
and
the
little
student
s
cap
that
barely
covered
it
could
be
seen
now
as
well
as
his
pale
face
the
scarf
showed
white
only
in
front
behind
it
was
hidden
by
his
long
hair
believe
me
i
know
how
to
appreciate
your
generosity
abogin
muttered
as
he
helped
the
doctor
into
the
carriage
we
shall
get
there
quickly
drive
as
fast
as
you
can
luka
there
s
a
good
fellow
please
the
coachman
drove
rapidly
at
first
there
was
a
row
of
indistinct
buildings
that
stretched
alongside
the
hospital
yard
it
was
dark
everywhere
except
for
a
bright
light
from
a
window
that
gleamed
through
the
fence
into
the
furthest
part
of
the
yard
while
three
windows
of
the
upper
storey
of
the
hospital
looked
paler
than
the
surrounding
air
then
the
carriage
drove
into
dense
shadow
here
there
was
the
smell
of
dampness
and
mushrooms
and
the
sound
of
rustling
trees
the
crows
awakened
by
the
noise
of
the
wheels
stirred
among
the
foliage
and
uttered
prolonged
plaintive
cries
as
though
they
knew
the
doctor
s
son
was
dead
and
that
abogin
s
wife
was
ill
then
came
glimpses
of
separate
trees
of
bushes
a
pond
on
which
great
black
shadows
were
slumbering
gleamed
with
a
sullen
light
and
the
carriage
rolled
over
a
smooth
level
ground
the
clamour
of
the
crows
sounded
dimly
far
away
and
soon
ceased
altogether
kirilov
and
abogin
were
silent
almost
all
the
way
only
once
abogin
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
muttered
it
s
an
agonizing
state
one
never
loves
those
who
are
near
one
so
much
as
when
one
is
in
danger
of
losing
them
and
when
the
carriage
slowly
drove
over
the
river
kirilov
started
all
at
once
as
though
the
splash
of
the
water
had
frightened
him
and
made
a
movement
listen
let
me
go
he
said
miserably
i
ll
come
to
you
later
i
must
just
send
my
assistant
to
my
wife
she
is
alone
you
know
abogin
did
not
speak
the
carriage
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
crunching
over
the
stones
drove
up
the
sandy
bank
and
rolled
on
its
way
kirilov
moved
restlessly
and
looked
about
him
in
misery
behind
them
in
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
the
road
could
be
seen
and
the
riverside
willows
vanishing
into
the
darkness
on
the
right
lay
a
plain
as
uniform
and
as
boundless
as
the
sky
here
and
there
in
the
distance
probably
on
the
peat
marshes
dim
lights
were
glimmering
on
the
left
parallel
with
the
road
ran
a
hill
tufted
with
small
bushes
and
above
the
hill
stood
motionless
a
big
red
half
moon
slightly
veiled
with
mist
and
encircled
by
tiny
clouds
which
seemed
to
be
looking
round
at
it
from
all
sides
and
watching
that
it
did
not
go
away
in
all
nature
there
seemed
to
be
a
feeling
of
hopelessness
and
pain
the
earth
like
a
ruined
woman
sitting
alone
in
a
dark
room
and
trying
not
to
think
of
the
past
was
brooding
over
memories
of
spring
and
summer
and
apathetically
waiting
for
the
inevitable
winter
wherever
one
looked
on
all
sides
nature
seemed
like
a
dark
infinitely
deep
cold
pit
from
which
neither
kirilov
nor
abogin
nor
the
red
half
moon
could
escape
the
nearer
the
carriage
got
to
its
goal
the
more
impatient
abogin
became
he
kept
moving
leaping
up
looking
over
the
coachman
s
shoulder
and
when
at
last
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
entrance
which
was
elegantly
curtained
with
striped
linen
and
when
he
looked
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
second
storey
there
was
an
audible
catch
in
his
breath
if
anything
happens
i
shall
not
survive
it
he
said
going
into
the
hall
with
the
doctor
and
rubbing
his
hands
in
agitation
but
there
is
no
commotion
so
everything
must
be
going
well
so
far
he
added
listening
in
the
stillness
there
was
no
sound
in
the
hall
of
steps
or
voices
and
all
the
house
seemed
asleep
in
spite
of
the
lighted
windows
now
the
doctor
and
abogin
who
till
then
had
been
in
darkness
could
see
each
other
clearly
the
doctor
was
tall
and
stooped
was
untidily
dressed
and
not
good
looking
there
was
an
unpleasantly
harsh
morose
and
unfriendly
look
about
his
lips
thick
as
a
negro
s
his
aquiline
nose
and
listless
apathetic
eyes
his
unkempt
head
and
sunken
temples
the
premature
greyness
of
his
long
narrow
beard
through
which
his
chin
was
visible
the
pale
grey
hue
of
his
skin
and
his
careless
uncouth
manners
the
harshness
of
all
this
was
suggestive
of
years
of
poverty
of
ill
fortune
of
weariness
with
life
and
with
men
looking
at
his
frigid
figure
one
could
hardly
believe
that
this
man
had
a
wife
that
he
was
capable
of
weeping
over
his
child
abogin
presented
a
very
different
appearance
he
was
a
thick
set
sturdy
looking
fair
man
with
a
big
head
and
large
soft
features
he
was
elegantly
dressed
in
the
very
latest
fashion
in
his
carriage
his
closely
buttoned
coat
his
long
hair
and
his
face
there
was
a
suggestion
of
something
generous
leonine
he
walked
with
his
head
erect
and
his
chest
squared
he
spoke
in
an
agreeable
baritone
and
there
was
a
shade
of
refined
almost
feminine
elegance
in
the
manner
in
which
he
took
off
his
scarf
and
smoothed
his
hair
even
his
paleness
and
the
childlike
terror
with
which
he
looked
up
at
the
stairs
as
he
took
off
his
coat
did
not
detract
from
his
dignity
nor
diminish
the
air
of
sleekness
health
and
aplomb
which
characterized
his
whole
figure
there
is
nobody
and
no
sound
he
said
going
up
the
stairs
there
is
no
commotion
god
grant
all
is
well
he
led
the
doctor
through
the
hall
into
a
big
drawing
room
where
there
was
a
black
piano
and
a
chandelier
in
a
white
cover
from
there
they
both
went
into
a
very
snug
pretty
little
drawing
room
full
of
an
agreeable
rosy
twilight
well
sit
down
here
doctor
and
i
will
be
back
directly
i
will
go
and
have
a
look
and
prepare
them
kirilov
was
left
alone
the
luxury
of
the
drawing
room
the
agreeably
subdued
light
and
his
own
presence
in
the
stranger
s
unfamiliar
house
which
had
something
of
the
character
of
an
adventure
did
not
apparently
affect
him
he
sat
in
a
low
chair
and
scrutinized
his
hands
which
were
burnt
with
carbolic
he
only
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
bright
red
lamp
shade
and
the
violoncello
case
and
glancing
in
the
direction
where
the
clock
was
ticking
he
noticed
a
stuffed
wolf
as
substantial
and
sleek
looking
as
abogin
himself
it
was
quiet
somewhere
far
away
in
the
adjoining
rooms
someone
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
ah
there
was
a
clang
of
a
glass
door
probably
of
a
cupboard
and
again
all
was
still
after
waiting
five
minutes
kirilov
left
off
scrutinizing
his
hands
and
raised
his
eyes
to
the
door
by
which
abogin
had
vanished
in
the
doorway
stood
abogin
but
he
was
not
the
same
as
when
he
had
gone
out
the
look
of
sleekness
and
refined
elegance
had
disappeared
his
face
his
hands
his
attitude
were
contorted
by
a
revolting
expression
of
something
between
horror
and
agonizing
physical
pain
his
nose
his
lips
his
moustache
all
his
features
were
moving
and
seemed
trying
to
tear
themselves
from
his
face
his
eyes
looked
as
though
they
were
laughing
with
agony
abogin
took
a
heavy
stride
into
the
drawing
room
bent
forward
moaned
and
shook
his
fists
she
has
deceived
me
he
cried
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
second
syllable
of
the
verb
deceived
me
gone
away
she
fell
ill
and
sent
me
for
the
doctor
only
to
run
away
with
that
clown
paptchinsky
my
god
abogin
took
a
heavy
step
towards
the
doctor
held
out
his
soft
white
fists
in
his
face
and
shaking
them
went
on
yelling
gone
away
deceived
me
but
why
this
deception
my
god
my
god
what
need
of
this
dirty
scoundrelly
trick
this
diabolical
snakish
farce
what
have
i
done
to
her
gone
away
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
he
turned
on
one
foot
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
drawing
room
now
in
his
short
coat
his
fashionable
narrow
trousers
which
made
his
legs
look
disproportionately
slim
with
his
big
head
and
long
mane
he
was
extremely
like
a
lion
a
gleam
of
curiosity
came
into
the
apathetic
face
of
the
doctor
he
got
up
and
looked
at
abogin
excuse
me
where
is
the
patient
he
said
the
patient
the
patient
cried
abogin
laughing
crying
and
still
brandishing
his
fists
she
is
not
ill
but
accursed
the
baseness
the
vileness
the
devil
himself
could
not
have
imagined
anything
more
loathsome
she
sent
me
off
that
she
might
run
away
with
a
buffoon
a
dull
witted
clown
an
alphonse
oh
god
better
she
had
died
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
bear
it
the
doctor
drew
himself
up
his
eyes
bblinked
and
filled
with
tears
his
narrow
beard
began
moving
to
right
and
to
left
together
with
his
jaw
allow
me
to
ask
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
he
asked
looking
round
him
with
curiosity
my
child
is
dead
my
wife
is
in
grief
alone
in
the
whole
house
i
myself
can
scarcely
stand
up
i
have
not
slept
for
three
nights
and
here
i
am
forced
to
play
a
part
in
some
vulgar
farce
to
play
the
part
of
a
stage
property
i
don
t
don
t
understand
it
abogin
unclenched
one
fist
flung
a
crumpled
note
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
as
though
it
were
an
insect
he
wanted
to
crush
and
i
didn
t
see
didn
t
understand
he
said
through
his
clenched
teeth
brandishing
one
fist
before
his
face
with
an
expression
as
though
some
one
had
trodden
on
his
corns
i
did
not
notice
that
he
came
every
day
i
did
not
notice
that
he
came
today
in
a
closed
carriage
what
did
he
come
in
a
closed
carriage
for
and
i
did
not
see
it
noodle
i
don
t
understand
muttered
the
doctor
why
what
s
the
meaning
of
it
why
it
s
an
outrage
on
personal
dignity
a
mockery
of
human
suffering
it
s
incredible
it
s
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
had
such
an
experience
with
the
dull
surprise
of
a
man
who
has
only
just
realized
that
he
has
been
bitterly
insulted
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
flung
wide
his
arms
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
to
say
sank
helplessly
into
a
chair
if
you
have
ceased
to
love
me
and
love
another
so
be
it
but
why
this
deceit
why
this
vulgar
treacherous
trick
abogin
said
in
a
tearful
voice
what
is
the
object
of
it
and
what
is
there
to
justify
it
and
what
have
i
done
to
you
listen
doctor
he
said
hotly
going
up
to
kirilov
you
have
been
the
involuntary
witness
of
my
misfortune
and
i
am
not
going
to
conceal
the
truth
from
you
i
swear
that
i
loved
the
woman
loved
her
devotedly
like
a
slave
i
have
sacrificed
everything
for
her
i
have
quarrelled
with
my
own
people
i
have
given
up
the
service
and
music
i
have
forgiven
her
what
i
could
not
have
forgiven
my
own
mother
or
sister
i
have
never
looked
askance
at
her
i
have
never
gainsaid
her
in
anything
why
this
deception
i
do
not
demand
love
but
why
this
loathsome
duplicity
if
she
did
not
love
me
why
did
she
not
say
so
openly
honestly
especially
as
she
knows
my
views
on
the
subject
with
tears
in
his
eyes
trembling
all
over
abogin
opened
his
heart
to
the
doctor
with
perfect
sincerity
he
spoke
warmly
pressing
both
hands
on
his
heart
exposing
the
secrets
of
his
private
life
without
the
faintest
hesitation
and
even
seemed
to
be
glad
that
at
last
these
secrets
were
no
longer
pent
up
in
his
breast
if
he
had
talked
in
this
way
for
an
hour
or
two
and
opened
his
heart
he
would
undoubtedly
have
felt
better
who
knows
if
the
doctor
had
listened
to
him
and
had
sympathized
with
him
like
a
friend
he
might
perhaps
as
often
happens
have
reconciled
himself
to
his
trouble
without
protest
without
doing
anything
needless
and
absurd
but
what
happened
was
quite
different
while
abogin
was
speaking
the
outraged
doctor
perceptibly
changed
the
indifference
and
wonder
on
his
face
gradually
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
bitter
resentment
indignation
and
anger
the
features
of
his
face
became
even
harsher
coarser
and
more
unpleasant
when
abogin
held
out
before
his
eyes
the
photograph
of
a
young
woman
with
a
handsome
face
as
cold
and
expressionless
as
a
nun
s
and
asked
him
whether
looking
at
that
face
one
could
conceive
that
it
was
capable
of
duplicity
the
doctor
suddenly
flew
out
and
with
flashing
eyes
said
rudely
rapping
out
each
word
what
are
you
telling
me
all
this
for
i
have
no
desire
to
hear
it
i
have
no
desire
to
he
shouted
and
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
i
don
t
want
your
vulgar
secrets
damnation
take
them
don
t
dare
to
tell
me
of
such
vulgar
doings
do
you
consider
that
i
have
not
been
insulted
enough
already
that
i
am
a
flunkey
whom
you
can
insult
without
restraint
is
that
it
abogin
staggered
back
from
kirilov
and
stared
at
him
in
amazement
why
did
you
bring
me
here
the
doctor
went
on
his
beard
quivering
if
you
are
so
puffed
up
with
good
living
that
you
go
and
get
married
and
then
act
a
farce
like
this
how
do
i
come
in
what
have
i
to
do
with
your
love
affairs
leave
me
in
peace
go
on
squeezing
money
out
of
the
poor
in
your
gentlemanly
way
make
a
display
of
humane
ideas
play
the
doctor
looked
sideways
at
the
violoncello
case
play
the
bassoon
and
the
trombone
grow
as
fat
as
capons
but
don
t
dare
to
insult
personal
dignity
if
you
can
not
respect
it
you
might
at
least
spare
it
your
attention
excuse
me
what
does
all
this
mean
abogin
asked
flushing
red
it
means
that
it
s
base
and
low
to
play
with
people
like
this
i
am
a
doctor
you
look
upon
doctors
and
people
generally
who
work
and
don
t
stink
of
perfume
and
prostitution
as
your
menials
and
mauvais
ton
well
you
may
look
upon
them
so
but
no
one
has
given
you
the
right
to
treat
a
man
who
is
suffering
as
a
stage
property
how
dare
you
say
that
to
me
abogin
said
quietly
and
his
face
began
working
again
and
this
time
unmistakably
from
anger
no
how
dared
you
knowing
of
my
sorrow
bring
me
here
to
listen
to
these
vulgarities
shouted
the
doctor
and
he
again
banged
on
the
table
with
his
fist
who
has
given
you
the
right
to
make
a
mockery
of
another
man
s
sorrow
you
have
taken
leave
of
your
senses
shouted
abogin
it
is
ungenerous
i
am
intensely
unhappy
myself
and
and
unhappy
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
of
contempt
don
t
utter
that
word
it
does
not
concern
you
the
spendthrift
who
can
not
raise
a
loan
calls
himself
unhappy
too
the
capon
sluggish
from
over
feeding
is
unhappy
too
worthless
people
sir
you
forget
yourself
shrieked
abogin
for
saying
things
like
that
people
are
thrashed
do
you
understand
abogin
hurriedly
felt
in
his
side
pocket
pulled
out
a
pocket
book
and
extracting
two
notes
flung
them
on
the
table
here
is
the
fee
for
your
visit
he
said
his
nostrils
dilating
you
are
paid
how
dare
you
offer
me
money
shouted
the
doctor
and
he
brushed
the
notes
off
the
table
on
to
the
floor
an
insult
can
not
be
paid
for
in
money
abogin
and
the
doctor
stood
face
to
face
and
in
their
wrath
continued
flinging
undeserved
insults
at
each
other
i
believe
that
never
in
their
lives
even
in
delirium
had
they
uttered
so
much
that
was
unjust
cruel
and
absurd
the
egoism
of
the
unhappy
was
conspicuous
in
both
the
unhappy
are
egoistic
spiteful
unjust
cruel
and
less
capable
of
understanding
each
other
than
fools
unhappiness
does
not
bring
people
together
but
draws
them
apart
and
even
where
one
would
fancy
people
should
be
united
by
the
similarity
of
their
sorrow
far
more
injustice
and
cruelty
is
generated
than
in
comparatively
placid
surroundings
kindly
let
me
go
home
shouted
the
doctor
breathing
hard
abogin
rang
the
bell
sharply
when
no
one
came
to
answer
the
bell
he
rang
again
and
angrily
flung
the
bell
on
the
floor
it
fell
on
the
carpet
with
a
muffled
sound
and
uttered
a
plaintive
note
as
though
at
the
point
of
death
a
footman
came
in
where
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
the
devil
take
you
his
master
flew
at
him
clenching
his
fists
where
were
you
just
now
go
and
tell
them
to
bring
the
victoria
round
for
this
gentleman
and
order
the
closed
carriage
to
be
got
ready
for
me
stay
he
cried
as
the
footman
turned
to
go
out
i
won
t
have
a
single
traitor
in
the
house
by
to
morrow
away
with
you
all
i
will
engage
fresh
servants
reptiles
abogin
and
the
doctor
remained
in
silence
waiting
for
the
carriage
the
first
regained
his
expression
of
sleekness
and
his
refined
elegance
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
tossed
his
head
elegantly
and
was
evidently
meditating
on
something
his
anger
had
not
cooled
but
he
tried
to
appear
not
to
notice
his
enemy
the
doctor
stood
leaning
with
one
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
looked
at
abogin
with
that
profound
and
somewhat
cynical
ugly
contempt
only
to
be
found
in
the
eyes
of
sorrow
and
indigence
when
they
are
confronted
with
well
nourished
comfort
and
elegance
when
a
little
later
the
doctor
got
into
the
victoria
and
drove
off
there
was
still
a
look
of
contempt
in
his
eyes
it
was
dark
much
darker
than
it
had
been
an
hour
before
the
red
half
moon
had
sunk
behind
the
hill
and
the
clouds
that
had
been
guarding
it
lay
in
dark
patches
near
the
stars
the
carriage
with
red
lamps
rattled
along
the
road
and
soon
overtook
the
doctor
it
was
abogin
driving
off
to
protest
to
do
absurd
things
all
the
way
home
the
doctor
thought
not
of
his
wife
nor
of
his
andrey
but
of
abogin
and
the
people
in
the
house
he
had
just
left
his
thoughts
were
unjust
and
inhumanly
cruel
he
condemned
abogin
and
his
wife
and
paptchinsky
and
all
who
lived
in
rosy
subdued
light
among
sweet
perfumes
and
all
the
way
home
he
hated
and
despised
them
till
his
head
ached
and
a
firm
conviction
concerning
those
people
took
shape
in
his
mind
time
will
pass
and
kirilov
s
sorrow
will
pass
but
that
conviction
unjust
and
unworthy
of
the
human
heart
will
not
pass
but
will
remain
in
the
doctor
s
mind
to
the
grave
the
examining
magistrate
a
district
doctor
and
an
examining
magistrate
were
driving
one
fine
spring
day
to
an
inquest
the
examining
magistrate
a
man
of
five
and
thirty
looked
dreamily
at
the
horses
and
said
there
is
a
great
deal
that
is
enigmatic
and
obscure
in
nature
and
even
in
everyday
life
doctor
one
must
often
come
upon
phenomena
which
are
absolutely
incapable
of
explanation
i
know
for
instance
of
several
strange
mysterious
deaths
the
cause
of
which
only
spiritualists
and
mystics
will
undertake
to
explain
a
clear
headed
man
can
only
lift
up
his
hands
in
perplexity
for
example
i
know
of
a
highly
cultured
lady
who
foretold
her
own
death
and
died
without
any
apparent
reason
on
the
very
day
she
had
predicted
she
said
that
she
would
die
on
a
certain
day
and
she
did
die
there
s
no
effect
without
a
cause
said
the
doctor
if
there
s
a
death
there
must
be
a
cause
for
it
but
as
for
predicting
it
there
s
nothing
very
marvellous
in
that
all
our
ladies
all
our
females
in
fact
have
a
turn
for
prophecies
and
presentiments
just
so
but
my
lady
doctor
was
quite
a
special
case
there
was
nothing
like
the
ladies
or
other
females
presentiments
about
her
prediction
and
her
death
she
was
a
young
woman
healthy
and
clever
with
no
superstitions
of
any
sort
she
had
such
clear
intelligent
honest
eyes
an
open
sensible
face
with
a
faint
typically
russian
look
of
mockery
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
there
was
nothing
of
the
fine
lady
or
of
the
female
about
her
except
if
you
like
her
beauty
she
was
graceful
elegant
as
that
birch
tree
she
had
wonderful
hair
that
she
may
be
intelligible
to
you
i
will
add
too
that
she
was
a
person
of
the
most
infectious
gaiety
and
carelessness
and
that
intelligent
good
sort
of
frivolity
which
is
only
found
in
good
natured
light
hearted
people
with
brains
can
one
talk
of
mysticism
spiritualism
a
turn
for
presentiment
or
anything
of
that
sort
in
this
case
she
used
to
laugh
at
all
that
the
doctor
s
chaise
stopped
by
a
well
the
examining
magistrate
and
the
doctor
drank
some
water
stretched
and
waited
for
the
coachman
to
finish
watering
the
horses
well
what
did
the
lady
die
of
asked
the
doctor
when
the
chaise
was
rolling
along
the
road
again
she
died
in
a
strange
way
one
fine
day
her
husband
went
in
to
her
and
said
that
it
wouldn
t
be
amiss
to
sell
their
old
coach
before
the
spring
and
to
buy
something
rather
newer
and
lighter
instead
and
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
change
the
left
trace
horse
and
to
put
bobtchinsky
that
was
the
name
of
one
of
her
husband
s
horses
in
the
shafts
his
wife
listened
to
him
and
said
do
as
you
think
best
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
now
before
the
summer
i
shall
be
in
the
cemetery
her
husband
of
course
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
i
am
not
joking
she
said
i
tell
you
in
earnest
that
i
shall
soon
be
dead
what
do
you
mean
by
soon
directly
after
my
confinement
i
shall
bear
my
child
and
die
the
husband
attached
no
significance
to
these
words
he
did
not
believe
in
presentiments
of
any
sort
and
he
knew
that
ladies
in
an
interesting
condition
are
apt
to
be
fanciful
and
to
give
way
to
gloomy
ideas
generally
a
day
later
his
wife
spoke
to
him
again
of
dying
immediately
after
her
confinement
and
then
every
day
she
spoke
of
it
and
he
laughed
and
called
her
a
silly
woman
a
fortune
teller
a
crazy
creature
her
approaching
death
became
an
id
e
fix
with
his
wife
when
her
husband
would
not
listen
to
her
she
would
go
into
the
kitchen
and
talk
of
her
death
to
the
nurse
and
the
cook
i
haven
t
long
to
live
now
nurse
she
would
say
as
soon
as
my
confinement
is
over
i
shall
die
i
did
not
want
to
die
so
early
but
it
seems
it
s
my
fate
the
nurse
and
the
cook
were
in
tears
of
course
sometimes
the
priest
s
wife
or
some
lady
from
a
neighbouring
estate
would
come
and
see
her
and
she
would
take
them
aside
and
open
her
soul
to
them
always
harping
on
the
same
subject
her
approaching
death
she
spoke
gravely
with
an
unpleasant
smile
even
with
an
angry
face
which
would
not
allow
any
contradiction
she
had
been
smart
and
fashionable
in
her
dress
but
now
in
view
of
her
approaching
death
she
became
slovenly
she
did
not
read
she
did
not
laugh
she
did
not
dream
aloud
what
was
more
she
drove
with
her
aunt
to
the
cemetery
and
selected
a
spot
for
her
tomb
five
days
before
her
confinement
she
made
her
will
and
all
this
bear
in
mind
was
done
in
the
best
of
health
without
the
faintest
hint
of
illness
or
danger
a
confinement
is
a
difficult
affair
and
sometimes
fatal
but
in
the
case
of
which
i
am
telling
you
every
indication
was
favourable
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
her
husband
was
sick
of
the
whole
business
at
last
he
lost
his
temper
one
day
at
dinner
and
asked
her
listen
natasha
when
is
there
going
to
be
an
end
of
this
silliness
it
s
not
silliness
i
am
in
earnest
nonsense
i
advise
you
to
give
over
being
silly
that
you
may
not
feel
ashamed
of
it
afterwards
well
the
confinement
came
the
husband
got
the
very
best
midwife
from
the
town
it
was
his
wife
s
first
confinement
but
it
could
not
have
gone
better
when
it
was
all
over
she
asked
to
look
at
her
baby
she
looked
at
it
and
said
well
now
i
can
die
she
said
good
bye
shut
her
eyes
and
half
an
hour
later
gave
up
her
soul
to
god
she
was
fully
conscious
up
to
the
last
moment
anyway
when
they
gave
her
milk
instead
of
water
she
whispered
softly
why
are
you
giving
me
milk
instead
of
water
so
that
is
what
happened
she
died
as
she
predicted
the
examining
magistrate
paused
gave
a
sigh
and
said
come
explain
why
she
died
i
assure
you
on
my
honour
this
is
not
invented
it
s
a
fact
the
doctor
looked
at
the
sky
meditatively
you
ought
to
have
had
an
inquest
on
her
he
said
why
why
to
find
out
the
cause
of
her
death
she
didn
t
die
because
she
had
predicted
it
she
poisoned
herself
most
probably
the
examining
magistrate
turned
quickly
facing
the
doctor
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
asked
and
from
what
do
you
conclude
that
she
poisoned
herself
i
don
t
conclude
it
but
i
assume
it
was
she
on
good
terms
with
her
husband
h
m
not
altogether
there
had
been
misunderstandings
soon
after
their
marriage
there
were
unfortunate
circumstances
she
had
found
her
husband
on
one
occasion
with
a
lady
she
soon
forgave
him
however
and
which
came
first
her
husband
s
infidelity
or
her
idea
of
dying
the
examining
magistrate
looked
attentively
at
the
doctor
as
though
he
were
trying
to
imagine
why
he
put
that
question
excuse
me
he
said
not
quite
immediately
let
me
try
and
remember
the
examining
magistrate
took
off
his
hat
and
rubbed
his
forehead
yes
yes
it
was
very
shortly
after
that
incident
that
she
began
talking
of
death
yes
yes
well
there
do
you
see
in
all
probability
it
was
at
that
time
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
poison
herself
but
as
most
likely
she
did
not
want
to
kill
her
child
also
she
put
it
off
till
after
her
confinement
not
likely
not
likely
it
s
impossible
she
forgave
him
at
the
time
that
she
forgave
it
quickly
means
that
she
had
something
bad
in
her
mind
young
wives
do
not
forgive
quickly
the
examining
magistrate
gave
a
forced
smile
and
to
conceal
his
too
noticeable
agitation
began
lighting
a
cigarette
not
likely
not
likely
he
went
on
no
notion
of
anything
of
the
sort
being
possible
ever
entered
into
my
head
and
besides
he
was
not
so
much
to
blame
as
it
seems
he
was
unfaithful
to
her
in
rather
a
queer
way
with
no
desire
to
be
he
came
home
at
night
somewhat
elevated
wanted
to
make
love
to
somebody
his
wife
was
in
an
interesting
condition
then
he
came
across
a
lady
who
had
come
to
stay
for
three
days
damnation
take
her
an
empty
headed
creature
silly
and
not
good
looking
it
couldn
t
be
reckoned
as
an
infidelity
his
wife
looked
at
it
in
that
way
herself
and
soon
forgave
it
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
people
don
t
die
without
a
reason
said
the
doctor
that
is
so
of
course
but
all
the
same
i
can
not
admit
that
she
poisoned
herself
but
it
is
strange
that
the
idea
has
never
struck
me
before
and
no
one
thought
of
it
everyone
was
astonished
that
her
prediction
had
come
to
pass
and
the
idea
of
such
a
death
was
far
from
their
mind
and
indeed
it
can
not
be
that
she
poisoned
herself
no
the
examining
magistrate
pondered
the
thought
of
the
woman
who
had
died
so
strangely
haunted
him
all
through
the
inquest
as
he
noted
down
what
the
doctor
dictated
to
him
he
moved
his
eyebrows
gloomily
and
rubbed
his
forehead
and
are
there
really
poisons
that
kill
one
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
gradually
without
any
pain
he
asked
the
doctor
while
the
latter
was
opening
the
skull
yes
there
are
morphia
for
instance
h
m
strange
i
remember
she
used
to
keep
something
of
the
sort
but
it
could
hardly
be
on
the
way
back
the
examining
magistrate
looked
exhausted
he
kept
nervously
biting
his
moustache
and
was
unwilling
to
talk
let
us
go
a
little
way
on
foot
he
said
to
the
doctor
i
am
tired
of
sitting
after
walking
about
a
hundred
paces
the
examining
magistrate
seemed
to
the
doctor
to
be
overcome
with
fatigue
as
though
he
had
been
climbing
up
a
high
mountain
he
stopped
and
looking
at
the
doctor
with
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
drunk
said
my
god
if
your
theory
is
correct
why
it
s
it
was
cruel
inhuman
she
poisoned
herself
to
punish
some
one
else
why
was
the
sin
so
great
oh
my
god
and
why
did
you
make
me
a
present
of
this
damnable
idea
doctor
the
examining
magistrate
clutched
at
his
head
in
despair
and
went
on
what
i
have
told
you
was
about
my
own
wife
about
myself
oh
my
god
i
was
to
blame
i
wounded
her
but
can
it
have
been
easier
to
die
than
to
forgive
that
s
typical
feminine
logic
cruel
merciless
logic
oh
even
then
when
she
was
living
she
was
cruel
i
recall
it
all
now
it
s
all
clear
to
me
now
as
the
examining
magistrate
talked
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
clutched
at
his
head
he
got
back
into
the
carriage
then
walked
again
the
new
idea
the
doctor
had
imparted
to
him
seemed
to
have
overwhelmed
him
to
have
poisoned
him
he
was
distracted
shattered
in
body
and
soul
and
when
he
got
back
to
the
town
he
said
good
bye
to
the
doctor
declining
to
stay
to
dinner
though
he
had
promised
the
doctor
the
evening
before
to
dine
with
him
betrothed
i
it
was
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
the
full
moon
was
shining
over
the
garden
in
the
shumins
house
an
evening
service
celebrated
at
the
request
of
the
grandmother
marfa
mihalovna
was
just
over
and
now
nadya
she
had
gone
into
the
garden
for
a
minute
could
see
the
table
being
laid
for
supper
in
the
dining
room
and
her
grandmother
bustling
about
in
her
gorgeous
silk
dress
father
andrey
a
chief
priest
of
the
cathedral
was
talking
to
nadya
s
mother
nina
ivanovna
and
now
in
the
evening
light
through
the
window
her
mother
for
some
reason
looked
very
young
andrey
andreitch
father
andrey
s
son
was
standing
by
listening
attentively
it
was
still
and
cool
in
the
garden
and
dark
peaceful
shadows
lay
on
the
ground
there
was
a
sound
of
frogs
croaking
far
far
away
beyond
the
town
there
was
a
feeling
of
may
sweet
may
one
drew
deep
breaths
and
longed
to
fancy
that
not
here
but
far
away
under
the
sky
above
the
trees
far
away
in
the
open
country
in
the
fields
and
the
woods
the
life
of
spring
was
unfolding
now
mysterious
lovely
rich
and
holy
beyond
the
understanding
of
weak
sinful
man
and
for
some
reason
one
wanted
to
cry
she
nadya
was
already
twenty
three
ever
since
she
was
sixteen
she
had
been
passionately
dreaming
of
marriage
and
at
last
she
was
engaged
to
andrey
andreitch
the
young
man
who
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
window
she
liked
him
the
wedding
was
already
fixed
for
july
7
and
yet
there
was
no
joy
in
her
heart
she
was
sleeping
badly
her
spirits
drooped
she
could
hear
from
the
open
windows
of
the
basement
where
the
kitchen
was
the
hurrying
servants
the
clatter
of
knives
the
banging
of
the
swing
door
there
was
a
smell
of
roast
turkey
and
pickled
cherries
and
for
some
reason
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
be
like
that
all
her
life
with
no
change
no
end
to
it
some
one
came
out
of
the
house
and
stood
on
the
steps
it
was
alexandr
timofeitch
or
as
he
was
always
called
sasha
who
had
come
from
moscow
ten
days
before
and
was
staying
with
them
years
ago
a
distant
relation
of
the
grandmother
a
gentleman
s
widow
called
marya
petrovna
a
thin
sickly
little
woman
who
had
sunk
into
poverty
used
to
come
to
the
house
to
ask
for
assistance
she
had
a
son
sasha
it
used
for
some
reason
to
be
said
that
he
had
talent
as
an
artist
and
when
his
mother
died
nadya
s
grandmother
had
for
the
salvation
of
her
soul
sent
him
to
the
komissarovsky
school
in
moscow
two
years
later
he
went
into
the
school
of
painting
spent
nearly
fifteen
years
there
and
only
just
managed
to
scrape
through
the
leaving
examination
in
the
section
of
architecture
he
did
not
set
up
as
an
architect
however
but
took
a
job
at
a
lithographer
s
he
used
to
come
almost
every
year
usually
very
ill
to
stay
with
nadya
s
grandmother
to
rest
and
recover
he
was
wearing
now
a
frock
coat
buttoned
up
and
shabby
canvas
trousers
crumpled
into
creases
at
the
bottom
and
his
shirt
had
not
been
ironed
and
he
had
somehow
all
over
a
look
of
not
being
fresh
he
was
very
thin
with
big
eyes
long
thin
fingers
and
a
swarthy
bearded
face
and
all
the
same
he
was
handsome
with
the
shumins
he
was
like
one
of
the
family
and
in
their
house
felt
he
was
at
home
and
the
room
in
which
he
lived
when
he
was
there
had
for
years
been
called
sasha
s
room
standing
on
the
steps
he
saw
nadya
and
went
up
to
her
it
s
nice
here
he
said
of
course
it
s
nice
you
ought
to
stay
here
till
the
autumn
yes
i
expect
it
will
come
to
that
i
dare
say
i
shall
stay
with
you
till
september
he
laughed
for
no
reason
and
sat
down
beside
her
i
m
sitting
gazing
at
mother
said
nadya
she
looks
so
young
from
here
my
mother
has
her
weaknesses
of
course
she
added
after
a
pause
but
still
she
is
an
exceptional
woman
yes
she
is
very
nice
sasha
agreed
your
mother
in
her
own
way
of
course
is
a
very
good
and
sweet
woman
but
how
shall
i
say
i
went
early
this
morning
into
your
kitchen
and
there
i
found
four
servants
sleeping
on
the
floor
no
bedsteads
and
rags
for
bedding
stench
bugs
beetles
it
is
just
as
it
was
twenty
years
ago
no
change
at
all
well
granny
god
bless
her
what
else
can
you
expect
of
granny
but
your
mother
speaks
french
you
know
and
acts
in
private
theatricals
one
would
think
she
might
understand
as
sasha
talked
he
used
to
stretch
out
two
long
wasted
fingers
before
the
listener
s
face
it
all
seems
somehow
strange
to
me
here
now
i
am
out
of
the
habit
of
it
he
went
on
there
is
no
making
it
out
nobody
ever
does
anything
your
mother
spends
the
whole
day
walking
about
like
a
duchess
granny
does
nothing
either
nor
you
either
and
your
andrey
andreitch
never
does
anything
either
nadya
had
heard
this
the
year
before
and
she
fancied
the
year
before
that
too
and
she
knew
that
sasha
could
not
make
any
other
criticism
and
in
old
days
this
had
amused
her
but
now
for
some
reason
she
felt
annoyed
that
s
all
stale
and
i
have
been
sick
of
it
for
ages
she
said
and
got
up
you
should
think
of
something
a
little
newer
he
laughed
and
got
up
too
and
they
went
together
toward
the
house
she
tall
handsome
and
well
made
beside
him
looked
very
healthy
and
smartly
dressed
she
was
conscious
of
this
and
felt
sorry
for
him
and
for
some
reason
awkward
and
you
say
a
great
deal
you
should
not
she
said
you
ve
just
been
talking
about
my
andrey
but
you
see
you
don
t
know
him
my
andrey
bother
him
your
andrey
i
am
sorry
for
your
youth
they
were
already
sitting
down
to
supper
as
the
young
people
went
into
the
dining
room
the
grandmother
or
granny
as
she
was
called
in
the
household
a
very
stout
plain
old
lady
with
bushy
eyebrows
and
a
little
moustache
was
talking
loudly
and
from
her
voice
and
manner
of
speaking
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
the
person
of
most
importance
in
the
house
she
owned
rows
of
shops
in
the
market
and
the
old
fashioned
house
with
columns
and
the
garden
yet
she
prayed
every
morning
that
god
might
save
her
from
ruin
and
shed
tears
as
she
did
so
her
daughter
in
law
nadya
s
mother
nina
ivanovna
a
fair
haired
woman
tightly
laced
in
with
a
pince
nez
and
diamonds
on
every
finger
father
andrey
a
lean
toothless
old
man
whose
face
always
looked
as
though
he
were
just
going
to
say
something
amusing
and
his
son
andrey
andreitch
a
stout
and
handsome
young
man
with
curly
hair
looking
like
an
artist
or
an
actor
were
all
talking
of
hypnotism
you
will
get
well
in
a
week
here
said
granny
addressing
sasha
only
you
must
eat
more
what
do
you
look
like
she
sighed
you
are
really
dreadful
you
are
a
regular
prodigal
son
that
is
what
you
are
after
wasting
his
father
s
substance
in
riotous
living
said
father
andrey
slowly
with
laughing
eyes
he
fed
with
senseless
beasts
i
like
my
dad
said
andrey
andreitch
touching
his
father
on
the
shoulder
he
is
a
splendid
old
fellow
a
dear
old
fellow
everyone
was
silent
for
a
space
sasha
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
and
put
his
dinner
napkin
to
his
mouth
so
you
believe
in
hypnotism
said
father
andrey
to
nina
ivanovna
i
can
not
of
course
assert
that
i
believe
answered
nina
ivanovna
assuming
a
very
serious
even
severe
expression
but
i
must
own
that
there
is
much
that
is
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
in
nature
i
quite
agree
with
you
though
i
must
add
that
religion
distinctly
curtails
for
us
the
domain
of
the
mysterious
a
big
and
very
fat
turkey
was
served
father
andrey
and
nina
ivanovna
went
on
with
their
conversation
nina
ivanovna
s
diamonds
glittered
on
her
fingers
then
tears
began
to
glitter
in
her
eyes
she
grew
excited
though
i
can
not
venture
to
argue
with
you
she
said
you
must
admit
there
are
so
many
insoluble
riddles
in
life
not
one
i
assure
you
after
supper
andrey
andreitch
played
the
fiddle
and
nina
ivanovna
accompanied
him
on
the
piano
ten
years
before
he
had
taken
his
degree
at
the
university
in
the
faculty
of
arts
but
had
never
held
any
post
had
no
definite
work
and
only
from
time
to
time
took
part
in
concerts
for
charitable
objects
and
in
the
town
he
was
regarded
as
a
musician
andrey
andreitch
played
they
all
listened
in
silence
the
samovar
was
boiling
quietly
on
the
table
and
no
one
but
sasha
was
drinking
tea
then
when
it
struck
twelve
a
violin
string
suddenly
broke
everyone
laughed
bustled
about
and
began
saying
good
bye
after
seeing
her
fianc
out
nadya
went
upstairs
where
she
and
her
mother
had
their
rooms
the
lower
storey
was
occupied
by
the
grandmother
they
began
putting
the
lights
out
below
in
the
dining
room
while
sasha
still
sat
on
drinking
tea
he
always
spent
a
long
time
over
tea
in
the
moscow
style
drinking
as
much
as
seven
glasses
at
a
time
for
a
long
time
after
nadya
had
undressed
and
gone
to
bed
she
could
hear
the
servants
clearing
away
downstairs
and
granny
talking
angrily
at
last
everything
was
hushed
and
nothing
could
be
heard
but
sasha
from
time
to
time
coughing
on
a
bass
note
in
his
room
below
ii
when
nadya
woke
up
it
must
have
been
two
o
clock
it
was
beginning
to
get
light
a
watchman
was
tapping
somewhere
far
away
she
was
not
sleepy
and
her
bed
felt
very
soft
and
uncomfortable
nadya
sat
up
in
her
bed
and
fell
to
thinking
as
she
had
done
every
night
in
may
her
thoughts
were
the
same
as
they
had
been
the
night
before
useless
persistent
thoughts
always
alike
of
how
andrey
andreitch
had
begun
courting
her
and
had
made
her
an
offer
how
she
had
accepted
him
and
then
little
by
little
had
come
to
appreciate
the
kindly
intelligent
man
but
for
some
reason
now
when
there
was
hardly
a
month
left
before
the
wedding
she
began
to
feel
dread
and
uneasiness
as
though
something
vague
and
oppressive
were
before
her
tick
tock
tick
tock
the
watchman
tapped
lazily
tick
tock
through
the
big
old
fashioned
window
she
could
see
the
garden
and
at
a
little
distance
bushes
of
lilac
in
full
flower
drowsy
and
lifeless
from
the
cold
and
the
thick
white
mist
was
floating
softly
up
to
the
lilac
trying
to
cover
it
drowsy
rooks
were
cawing
in
the
far
away
trees
my
god
why
is
my
heart
so
heavy
perhaps
every
girl
felt
the
same
before
her
wedding
there
was
no
knowing
or
was
it
sasha
s
influence
but
for
several
years
past
sasha
had
been
repeating
the
same
thing
like
a
copybook
and
when
he
talked
he
seemed
na
ve
and
queer
but
why
was
it
she
could
not
get
sasha
out
of
her
head
why
was
it
the
watchman
left
off
tapping
for
a
long
while
the
birds
were
twittering
under
the
windows
and
the
mist
had
disappeared
from
the
garden
everything
was
lighted
up
by
the
spring
sunshine
as
by
a
smile
soon
the
whole
garden
warm
and
caressed
by
the
sun
returned
to
life
and
dewdrops
like
diamonds
glittered
on
the
leaves
and
the
old
neglected
garden
on
that
morning
looked
young
and
gaily
decked
granny
was
already
awake
sasha
s
husky
cough
began
nadya
could
hear
them
below
setting
the
samovar
and
moving
the
chairs
the
hours
passed
slowly
nadya
had
been
up
and
walking
about
the
garden
for
a
long
while
and
still
the
morning
dragged
on
at
last
nina
ivanovna
appeared
with
a
tear
stained
face
carrying
a
glass
of
mineral
water
she
was
interested
in
spiritualism
and
homeopathy
read
a
great
deal
was
fond
of
talking
of
the
doubts
to
which
she
was
subject
and
to
nadya
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
a
deep
mysterious
significance
in
all
that
now
nadya
kissed
her
mother
and
walked
beside
her
what
have
you
been
crying
about
mother
she
asked
last
night
i
was
reading
a
story
in
which
there
is
an
old
man
and
his
daughter
the
old
man
is
in
some
office
and
his
chief
falls
in
love
with
his
daughter
i
have
not
finished
it
but
there
was
a
passage
which
made
it
hard
to
keep
from
tears
said
nina
ivanovna
and
she
sipped
at
her
glass
i
thought
of
it
this
morning
and
shed
tears
again
i
have
been
so
depressed
all
these
days
said
nadya
after
a
pause
why
is
it
i
don
t
sleep
at
night
i
don
t
know
dear
when
i
can
t
sleep
i
shut
my
eyes
very
tightly
like
this
and
picture
to
myself
anna
karenin
moving
about
and
talking
or
something
historical
from
the
ancient
world
nadya
felt
that
her
mother
did
not
understand
her
and
was
incapable
of
understanding
she
felt
this
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
it
positively
frightened
her
and
made
her
want
to
hide
herself
and
she
went
away
to
her
own
room
at
two
o
clock
they
sat
down
to
dinner
it
was
wednesday
a
fast
day
and
so
vegetable
soup
and
bream
with
boiled
grain
were
set
before
granny
to
tease
granny
sasha
ate
his
meat
soup
as
well
as
the
vegetable
soup
he
was
making
jokes
all
through
dinner
time
but
his
jests
were
laboured
and
invariably
with
a
moral
bearing
and
the
effect
was
not
at
all
amusing
when
before
making
some
witty
remark
he
raised
his
very
long
thin
deathly
looking
fingers
and
when
one
remembered
that
he
was
very
ill
and
would
probably
not
be
much
longer
in
this
world
one
felt
sorry
for
him
and
ready
to
weep
after
dinner
granny
went
off
to
her
own
room
to
lie
down
nina
ivanovna
played
on
the
piano
for
a
little
and
then
she
too
went
away
oh
dear
nadya
sasha
began
his
usual
afternoon
conversation
if
only
you
would
listen
to
me
if
only
you
would
she
was
sitting
far
back
in
an
old
fashioned
armchair
with
her
eyes
shut
while
he
paced
slowly
about
the
room
from
corner
to
corner
if
only
you
would
go
to
the
university
he
said
only
enlightened
and
holy
people
are
interesting
it
s
only
they
who
are
wanted
the
more
of
such
people
there
are
the
sooner
the
kingdom
of
god
will
come
on
earth
of
your
town
then
not
one
stone
will
be
left
everything
will
be
blown
up
from
the
foundations
everything
will
be
changed
as
though
by
magic
and
then
there
will
be
immense
magnificent
houses
here
wonderful
gardens
marvellous
fountains
remarkable
people
but
that
s
not
what
matters
most
what
matters
most
is
that
the
crowd
in
our
sense
of
the
word
in
the
sense
in
which
it
exists
now
that
evil
will
not
exist
then
because
every
man
will
believe
and
every
man
will
know
what
he
is
living
for
and
no
one
will
seek
moral
support
in
the
crowd
dear
nadya
darling
girl
go
away
show
them
all
that
you
are
sick
of
this
stagnant
grey
sinful
life
prove
it
to
yourself
at
least
i
can
t
sasha
i
m
going
to
be
married
oh
nonsense
what
s
it
for
they
went
out
into
the
garden
and
walked
up
and
down
a
little
and
however
that
may
be
my
dear
girl
you
must
think
you
must
realize
how
unclean
how
immoral
this
idle
life
of
yours
is
sasha
went
on
do
understand
that
if
for
instance
you
and
your
mother
and
your
grandmother
do
nothing
it
means
that
someone
else
is
working
for
you
you
are
eating
up
someone
else
s
life
and
is
that
clean
isn
t
it
filthy
nadya
wanted
to
say
yes
that
is
true
she
wanted
to
say
that
she
understood
but
tears
came
into
her
eyes
her
spirits
drooped
and
shrinking
into
herself
she
went
off
to
her
room
towards
evening
andrey
andreitch
arrived
and
as
usual
played
the
fiddle
for
a
long
time
he
was
not
given
to
much
talk
as
a
rule
and
was
fond
of
the
fiddle
perhaps
because
one
could
be
silent
while
playing
at
eleven
o
clock
when
he
was
about
to
go
home
and
had
put
on
his
greatcoat
he
embraced
nadya
and
began
greedily
kissing
her
face
her
shoulders
and
her
hands
my
dear
my
sweet
my
charmer
he
muttered
oh
how
happy
i
am
i
am
beside
myself
with
rapture
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
had
heard
that
long
long
ago
or
had
read
it
somewhere
in
some
old
tattered
novel
thrown
away
long
ago
in
the
dining
room
sasha
was
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
tea
with
the
saucer
poised
on
his
five
long
fingers
granny
was
laying
out
patience
nina
ivanovna
was
reading
the
flame
crackled
in
the
ikon
lamp
and
everything
it
seemed
was
quiet
and
going
well
nadya
said
good
night
went
upstairs
to
her
room
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
at
once
but
just
as
on
the
night
before
almost
before
it
was
light
she
woke
up
she
was
not
sleepy
there
was
an
uneasy
oppressive
feeling
in
her
heart
she
sat
up
with
her
head
on
her
knees
and
thought
of
her
fianc
and
her
marriage
she
for
some
reason
remembered
that
her
mother
had
not
loved
her
father
and
now
had
nothing
and
lived
in
complete
dependence
on
her
mother
in
law
granny
and
however
much
nadya
pondered
she
could
not
imagine
why
she
had
hitherto
seen
in
her
mother
something
special
and
exceptional
how
it
was
she
had
not
noticed
that
she
was
a
simple
ordinary
unhappy
woman
and
sasha
downstairs
was
not
asleep
she
could
hear
him
coughing
he
is
a
queer
na
ve
man
thought
nadya
and
in
all
his
dreams
in
all
those
marvellous
gardens
and
wonderful
fountains
one
felt
there
was
something
absurd
but
for
some
reason
in
his
na
vet
in
this
very
absurdity
there
was
something
so
beautiful
that
as
soon
as
she
thought
of
the
possibility
of
going
to
the
university
it
sent
a
cold
thrill
through
her
heart
and
her
bosom
and
flooded
them
with
joy
and
rapture
but
better
not
think
better
not
think
she
whispered
i
must
not
think
of
it
tick
tock
tapped
the
watchman
somewhere
far
away
tick
tock
tick
tock
iii
in
the
middle
of
june
sasha
suddenly
felt
bored
and
made
up
his
mind
to
return
to
moscow
i
can
t
exist
in
this
town
he
said
gloomily
no
water
supply
no
drains
it
disgusts
me
to
eat
at
dinner
the
filth
in
the
kitchen
is
incredible
wait
a
little
prodigal
son
granny
tried
to
persuade
him
speaking
for
some
reason
in
a
whisper
the
wedding
is
to
be
on
the
seventh
i
don
t
want
to
you
meant
to
stay
with
us
until
september
but
now
you
see
i
don
t
want
to
i
must
get
to
work
the
summer
was
grey
and
cold
the
trees
were
wet
everything
in
the
garden
looked
dejected
and
uninviting
it
certainly
did
make
one
long
to
get
to
work
the
sound
of
unfamiliar
women
s
voices
was
heard
downstairs
and
upstairs
there
was
the
rattle
of
a
sewing
machine
in
granny
s
room
they
were
working
hard
at
the
trousseau
of
fur
coats
alone
six
were
provided
for
nadya
and
the
cheapest
of
them
in
granny
s
words
had
cost
three
hundred
roubles
the
fuss
irritated
sasha
he
stayed
in
his
own
room
and
was
cross
but
everyone
persuaded
him
to
remain
and
he
promised
not
to
go
before
the
first
of
july
time
passed
quickly
on
st
peter
s
day
andrey
andreitch
went
with
nadya
after
dinner
to
moscow
street
to
look
once
more
at
the
house
which
had
been
taken
and
made
ready
for
the
young
couple
some
time
before
it
was
a
house
of
two
storeys
but
so
far
only
the
upper
floor
had
been
furnished
there
was
in
the
hall
a
shining
floor
painted
and
parqueted
there
were
viennese
chairs
a
piano
a
violin
stand
there
was
a
smell
of
paint
on
the
wall
hung
a
big
oil
painting
in
a
gold
frame
a
naked
lady
and
beside
her
a
purple
vase
with
a
broken
handle
an
exquisite
picture
said
andrey
andreitch
and
he
gave
a
respectful
sigh
it
s
the
work
of
the
artist
shismatchevsky
then
there
was
the
drawing
room
with
the
round
table
and
a
sofa
and
easy
chairs
upholstered
in
bright
blue
above
the
sofa
was
a
big
photograph
of
father
andrey
wearing
a
priest
s
velvet
cap
and
decorations
then
they
went
into
the
dining
room
in
which
there
was
a
sideboard
then
into
the
bedroom
here
in
the
half
dusk
stood
two
bedsteads
side
by
side
and
it
looked
as
though
the
bedroom
had
been
decorated
with
the
idea
that
it
would
always
be
very
agreeable
there
and
could
not
possibly
be
anything
else
andrey
andreitch
led
nadya
about
the
rooms
all
the
while
keeping
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
she
felt
weak
and
conscience
stricken
she
hated
all
the
rooms
the
beds
the
easy
chairs
she
was
nauseated
by
the
naked
lady
it
was
clear
to
her
now
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
andrey
andreitch
or
perhaps
had
never
loved
him
at
all
but
how
to
say
this
and
to
whom
to
say
it
and
with
what
object
she
did
not
understand
and
could
not
understand
though
she
was
thinking
about
it
all
day
and
all
night
he
held
her
round
the
waist
talked
so
affectionately
so
modestly
was
so
happy
walking
about
this
house
of
his
while
she
saw
nothing
in
it
all
but
vulgarity
stupid
na
ve
unbearable
vulgarity
and
his
arm
round
her
waist
felt
as
hard
and
cold
as
an
iron
hoop
and
every
minute
she
was
on
the
point
of
running
away
bursting
into
sobs
throwing
herself
out
of
a
window
andrey
andreitch
led
her
into
the
bathroom
and
here
he
touched
a
tap
fixed
in
the
wall
and
at
once
water
flowed
what
do
you
say
to
that
he
said
and
laughed
i
had
a
tank
holding
two
hundred
gallons
put
in
the
loft
and
so
now
we
shall
have
water
they
walked
across
the
yard
and
went
out
into
the
street
and
took
a
cab
thick
clouds
of
dust
were
blowing
and
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
just
going
to
rain
you
are
not
cold
said
andrey
andreitch
screwing
up
his
eyes
at
the
dust
she
did
not
answer
yesterday
you
remember
sasha
blamed
me
for
doing
nothing
he
said
after
a
brief
silence
well
he
is
right
absolutely
right
i
do
nothing
and
can
do
nothing
my
precious
why
is
it
why
is
it
that
the
very
thought
that
i
may
some
day
fix
a
cockade
on
my
cap
and
go
into
the
government
service
is
so
hateful
to
me
why
do
i
feel
so
uncomfortable
when
i
see
a
lawyer
or
a
latin
master
or
a
member
of
the
zemstvo
o
mother
russia
o
mother
russia
what
a
burden
of
idle
and
useless
people
you
still
carry
how
many
like
me
are
upon
you
long
suffering
mother
and
from
the
fact
that
he
did
nothing
he
drew
generalizations
seeing
in
it
a
sign
of
the
times
when
we
are
married
let
us
go
together
into
the
country
my
precious
there
we
will
work
we
will
buy
ourselves
a
little
piece
of
land
with
a
garden
and
a
river
we
will
labour
and
watch
life
oh
how
splendid
that
will
be
he
took
off
his
hat
and
his
hair
floated
in
the
wind
while
she
listened
to
him
and
thought
good
god
i
wish
i
were
home
when
they
were
quite
near
the
house
they
overtook
father
andrey
ah
here
s
father
coming
cried
andrey
andreitch
delighted
and
he
waved
his
hat
i
love
my
dad
really
he
said
as
he
paid
the
cabman
he
s
a
splendid
old
fellow
a
dear
old
fellow
nadya
went
into
the
house
feeling
cross
and
unwell
thinking
that
there
would
be
visitors
all
the
evening
that
she
would
have
to
entertain
them
to
smile
to
listen
to
the
fiddle
to
listen
to
all
sorts
of
nonsense
and
to
talk
of
nothing
but
the
wedding
granny
dignified
gorgeous
in
her
silk
dress
and
haughty
as
she
always
seemed
before
visitors
was
sitting
before
the
samovar
father
andrey
came
in
with
his
sly
smile
i
have
the
pleasure
and
blessed
consolation
of
seeing
you
in
health
he
said
to
granny
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
he
was
joking
or
speaking
seriously
iv
the
wind
was
beating
on
the
window
and
on
the
roof
there
was
a
whistling
sound
and
in
the
stove
the
house
spirit
was
plaintively
and
sullenly
droning
his
song
it
was
past
midnight
everyone
in
the
house
had
gone
to
bed
but
no
one
was
asleep
and
it
seemed
all
the
while
to
nadya
as
though
they
were
playing
the
fiddle
below
there
was
a
sharp
bang
a
shutter
must
have
been
torn
off
a
minute
later
nina
ivanovna
came
in
in
her
nightgown
with
a
candle
what
was
the
bang
nadya
she
asked
her
mother
with
her
hair
in
a
single
plait
and
a
timid
smile
on
her
face
looked
older
plainer
smaller
on
that
stormy
night
nadya
remembered
that
quite
a
little
time
ago
she
had
thought
her
mother
an
exceptional
woman
and
had
listened
with
pride
to
the
things
she
said
and
now
she
could
not
remember
those
things
everything
that
came
into
her
mind
was
so
feeble
and
useless
in
the
stove
was
the
sound
of
several
bass
voices
in
chorus
and
she
even
heard
o
o
o
my
g
o
od
nadya
sat
on
her
bed
and
suddenly
she
clutched
at
her
hair
and
burst
into
sobs
mother
mother
my
own
she
said
if
only
you
knew
what
is
happening
to
me
i
beg
you
i
beseech
you
let
me
go
away
i
beseech
you
where
asked
nina
ivanovna
not
understanding
and
she
sat
down
on
the
bedstead
go
where
for
a
long
while
nadya
cried
and
could
not
utter
a
word
let
me
go
away
from
the
town
she
said
at
last
there
must
not
and
will
not
be
a
wedding
understand
that
i
don
t
love
that
man
i
can
t
even
speak
about
him
no
my
own
no
nina
ivanovna
said
quickly
terribly
alarmed
calm
yourself
it
s
just
because
you
are
in
low
spirits
it
will
pass
it
often
happens
most
likely
you
have
had
a
tiff
with
andrey
but
lovers
quarrels
always
end
in
kisses
oh
go
away
mother
oh
go
away
sobbed
nadya
yes
said
nina
ivanovna
after
a
pause
it
s
not
long
since
you
were
a
baby
a
little
girl
and
now
you
are
engaged
to
be
married
in
nature
there
is
a
continual
transmutation
of
substances
before
you
know
where
you
are
you
will
be
a
mother
yourself
and
an
old
woman
and
will
have
as
rebellious
a
daughter
as
i
have
my
darling
my
sweet
you
are
clever
you
know
you
are
unhappy
said
nadya
you
are
very
unhappy
why
do
you
say
such
very
dull
commonplace
things
for
god
s
sake
why
nina
ivanovna
tried
to
say
something
but
could
not
utter
a
word
she
gave
a
sob
and
went
away
to
her
own
room
the
bass
voices
began
droning
in
the
stove
again
and
nadya
felt
suddenly
frightened
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
went
quickly
to
her
mother
nina
ivanovna
with
tear
stained
face
was
lying
in
bed
wrapped
in
a
pale
blue
quilt
and
holding
a
book
in
her
hands
mother
listen
to
me
said
nadya
i
implore
you
do
understand
if
you
would
only
understand
how
petty
and
degrading
our
life
is
my
eyes
have
been
opened
and
i
see
it
all
now
and
what
is
your
andrey
andreitch
why
he
is
not
intelligent
mother
merciful
heavens
do
understand
mother
he
is
stupid
nina
ivanovna
abruptly
sat
up
you
and
your
grandmother
torment
me
she
said
with
a
sob
i
want
to
live
to
live
she
repeated
and
twice
she
beat
her
little
fist
upon
her
bosom
let
me
be
free
i
am
still
young
i
want
to
live
and
you
have
made
me
an
old
woman
between
you
she
broke
into
bitter
tears
lay
down
and
curled
up
under
the
quilt
and
looked
so
small
so
pitiful
so
foolish
nadya
went
to
her
room
dressed
and
sitting
at
the
window
fell
to
waiting
for
the
morning
she
sat
all
night
thinking
while
someone
seemed
to
be
tapping
on
the
shutters
and
whistling
in
the
yard
in
the
morning
granny
complained
that
the
wind
had
blown
down
all
the
apples
in
the
garden
and
broken
down
an
old
plum
tree
it
was
grey
murky
cheerless
dark
enough
for
candles
everyone
complained
of
the
cold
and
the
rain
lashed
on
the
windows
after
tea
nadya
went
into
sasha
s
room
and
without
saying
a
word
knelt
down
before
an
armchair
in
the
corner
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
what
is
it
asked
sasha
i
can
t
she
said
how
i
could
go
on
living
here
before
i
can
t
understand
i
can
t
conceive
i
despise
the
man
i
am
engaged
to
i
despise
myself
i
despise
all
this
idle
senseless
existence
well
well
said
sasha
not
yet
grasping
what
was
meant
that
s
all
right
that
s
good
i
am
sick
of
this
life
nadya
went
on
i
can
t
endure
another
day
here
to
morrow
i
am
going
away
take
me
with
you
for
god
s
sake
for
a
minute
sasha
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
at
last
he
understood
and
was
delighted
as
a
child
he
waved
his
arms
and
began
pattering
with
his
slippers
as
though
he
were
dancing
with
delight
splendid
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
my
goodness
how
fine
that
is
and
she
stared
at
him
without
bblinking
with
adoring
eyes
as
though
spellbound
expecting
every
minute
that
he
would
say
something
important
something
infinitely
significant
he
had
told
her
nothing
yet
but
already
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
new
and
great
was
opening
before
her
which
she
had
not
known
till
then
and
already
she
gazed
at
him
full
of
expectation
ready
to
face
anything
even
death
i
am
going
to
morrow
he
said
after
a
moment
s
thought
you
come
to
the
station
to
see
me
off
i
ll
take
your
things
in
my
portmanteau
and
i
ll
get
your
ticket
and
when
the
third
bell
rings
you
get
into
the
carriage
and
we
ll
go
off
you
ll
see
me
as
far
as
moscow
and
then
go
on
to
petersburg
alone
have
you
a
passport
yes
i
can
promise
you
you
won
t
regret
it
said
sasha
with
conviction
you
will
go
you
will
study
and
then
go
where
fate
takes
you
when
you
turn
your
life
upside
down
everything
will
be
changed
the
great
thing
is
to
turn
your
life
upside
down
and
all
the
rest
is
unimportant
and
so
we
will
set
off
to
morrow
oh
yes
for
god
s
sake
it
seemed
to
nadya
that
she
was
very
much
excited
that
her
heart
was
heavier
than
ever
before
that
she
would
spend
all
the
time
till
she
went
away
in
misery
and
agonizing
thought
but
she
had
hardly
gone
upstairs
and
lain
down
on
her
bed
when
she
fell
asleep
at
once
with
traces
of
tears
and
a
smile
on
her
face
and
slept
soundly
till
evening
v
a
cab
had
been
sent
for
nadya
in
her
hat
and
overcoat
went
upstairs
to
take
one
more
look
at
her
mother
at
all
her
belongings
she
stood
in
her
own
room
beside
her
still
warm
bed
looked
about
her
then
went
slowly
in
to
her
mother
nina
ivanovna
was
asleep
it
was
quite
still
in
her
room
nadya
kissed
her
mother
smoothed
her
hair
stood
still
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
walked
slowly
downstairs
it
was
raining
heavily
the
cabman
with
the
hood
pulled
down
was
standing
at
the
entrance
drenched
with
rain
there
is
not
room
for
you
nadya
said
granny
as
the
servants
began
putting
in
the
luggage
what
an
idea
to
see
him
off
in
such
weather
you
had
better
stop
at
home
goodness
how
it
rains
nadya
tried
to
say
something
but
could
not
then
sasha
helped
nadya
in
and
covered
her
feet
with
a
rug
then
he
sat
down
beside
her
good
luck
to
you
god
bless
you
granny
cried
from
the
steps
mind
you
write
to
us
from
moscow
sasha
right
good
bye
granny
the
queen
of
heaven
keep
you
oh
what
weather
said
sasha
it
was
only
now
that
nadya
began
to
cry
now
it
was
clear
to
her
that
she
certainly
was
going
which
she
had
not
really
believed
when
she
was
saying
good
bye
to
granny
and
when
she
was
looking
at
her
mother
good
bye
town
and
she
suddenly
thought
of
it
all
andrey
and
his
father
and
the
new
house
and
the
naked
lady
with
the
vase
and
it
all
no
longer
frightened
her
nor
weighed
upon
her
but
was
na
ve
and
trivial
and
continually
retreated
further
away
and
when
they
got
into
the
railway
carriage
and
the
train
began
to
move
all
that
past
which
had
been
so
big
and
serious
shrank
up
into
something
tiny
and
a
vast
wide
future
which
till
then
had
scarcely
been
noticed
began
unfolding
before
her
the
rain
pattered
on
the
carriage
windows
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
green
fields
telegraph
posts
with
birds
sitting
on
the
wires
flitted
by
and
joy
made
her
hold
her
breath
she
thought
that
she
was
going
to
freedom
going
to
study
and
this
was
just
like
what
used
ages
ago
to
be
called
going
off
to
be
a
free
cossack
she
laughed
and
cried
and
prayed
all
at
once
it
s
a
all
right
said
sasha
smiling
it
s
a
all
right
vi
autumn
had
passed
and
winter
too
had
gone
nadya
had
begun
to
be
very
homesick
and
thought
every
day
of
her
mother
and
her
grandmother
she
thought
of
sasha
too
the
letters
that
came
from
home
were
kind
and
gentle
and
it
seemed
as
though
everything
by
now
were
forgiven
and
forgotten
in
may
after
the
examinations
she
set
off
for
home
in
good
health
and
high
spirits
and
stopped
on
the
way
at
moscow
to
see
sasha
he
was
just
the
same
as
the
year
before
with
the
same
beard
and
unkempt
hair
with
the
same
large
beautiful
eyes
and
he
still
wore
the
same
coat
and
canvas
trousers
but
he
looked
unwell
and
worried
he
seemed
both
older
and
thinner
and
kept
coughing
and
for
some
reason
he
struck
nadya
as
grey
and
provincial
my
god
nadya
has
come
he
said
and
laughed
gaily
my
darling
girl
they
sat
in
the
printing
room
which
was
full
of
tobacco
smoke
and
smelt
strongly
stiflingly
of
indian
ink
and
paint
then
they
went
to
his
room
which
also
smelt
of
tobacco
and
was
full
of
the
traces
of
spitting
near
a
cold
samovar
stood
a
broken
plate
with
dark
paper
on
it
and
there
were
masses
of
dead
flies
on
the
table
and
on
the
floor
and
everything
showed
that
sasha
ordered
his
personal
life
in
a
slovenly
way
and
lived
anyhow
with
utter
contempt
for
comfort
and
if
anyone
began
talking
to
him
of
his
personal
happiness
of
his
personal
life
of
affection
for
him
he
would
not
have
understood
and
would
have
only
laughed
it
is
all
right
everything
has
gone
well
said
nadya
hurriedly
mother
came
to
see
me
in
petersburg
in
the
autumn
she
said
that
granny
is
not
angry
and
only
keeps
going
into
my
room
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
the
walls
sasha
looked
cheerful
but
he
kept
coughing
and
talked
in
a
cracked
voice
and
nadya
kept
looking
at
him
unable
to
decide
whether
he
really
were
seriously
ill
or
whether
it
were
only
her
fancy
dear
sasha
she
said
you
are
ill
no
it
s
nothing
i
am
ill
but
not
very
oh
dear
cried
nadya
in
agitation
why
don
t
you
go
to
a
doctor
why
don
t
you
take
care
of
your
health
my
dear
darling
sasha
she
said
and
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
and
for
some
reason
there
rose
before
her
imagination
andrey
andreitch
and
the
naked
lady
with
the
vase
and
all
her
past
which
seemed
now
as
far
away
as
her
childhood
and
she
began
crying
because
sasha
no
longer
seemed
to
her
so
novel
so
cultured
and
so
interesting
as
the
year
before
dear
sasha
you
are
very
very
ill
i
would
do
anything
to
make
you
not
so
pale
and
thin
i
am
so
indebted
to
you
you
can
t
imagine
how
much
you
have
done
for
me
my
good
sasha
in
reality
you
are
now
the
person
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
they
sat
on
and
talked
and
now
after
nadya
had
spent
a
winter
in
petersburg
sasha
his
works
his
smile
his
whole
figure
had
for
her
a
suggestion
of
something
out
of
date
old
fashioned
done
with
long
ago
and
perhaps
already
dead
and
buried
i
am
going
down
the
volga
the
day
after
tomorrow
said
sasha
and
then
to
drink
koumiss
i
mean
to
drink
koumiss
a
friend
and
his
wife
are
going
with
me
his
wife
is
a
wonderful
woman
i
am
always
at
her
trying
to
persuade
her
to
go
to
the
university
i
want
her
to
turn
her
life
upside
down
after
having
talked
they
drove
to
the
station
sasha
got
her
tea
and
apples
and
when
the
train
began
moving
and
he
waved
his
handkerchief
at
her
smiling
it
could
be
seen
even
from
his
legs
that
he
was
very
ill
and
would
not
live
long
nadya
reached
her
native
town
at
midday
as
she
drove
home
from
the
station
the
streets
struck
her
as
very
wide
and
the
houses
very
small
and
squat
there
were
no
people
about
she
met
no
one
but
the
german
piano
tuner
in
a
rusty
greatcoat
and
all
the
houses
looked
as
though
they
were
covered
with
dust
granny
who
seemed
to
have
grown
quite
old
but
was
as
fat
and
plain
as
ever
flung
her
arms
round
nadya
and
cried
for
a
long
time
with
her
face
on
nadya
s
shoulder
unable
to
tear
herself
away
nina
ivanovna
looked
much
older
and
plainer
and
seemed
shrivelled
up
but
was
still
tightly
laced
and
still
had
diamonds
flashing
on
her
fingers
my
darling
she
said
trembling
all
over
my
darling
then
they
sat
down
and
cried
without
speaking
it
was
evident
that
both
mother
and
grandmother
realized
that
the
past
was
lost
and
gone
never
to
return
they
had
now
no
position
in
society
no
prestige
as
before
no
right
to
invite
visitors
so
it
is
when
in
the
midst
of
an
easy
careless
life
the
police
suddenly
burst
in
at
night
and
made
a
search
and
it
turns
out
that
the
head
of
the
family
has
embezzled
money
or
committed
forgery
and
goodbye
then
to
the
easy
careless
life
for
ever
nadya
went
upstairs
and
saw
the
same
bed
the
same
windows
with
na
ve
white
curtains
and
outside
the
windows
the
same
garden
gay
and
noisy
bathed
in
sunshine
she
touched
the
table
sat
down
and
sank
into
thought
and
she
had
a
good
dinner
and
drank
tea
with
delicious
rich
cream
but
something
was
missing
there
was
a
sense
of
emptiness
in
the
rooms
and
the
ceilings
were
so
low
in
the
evening
she
went
to
bed
covered
herself
up
and
for
some
reason
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
funny
lying
in
this
snug
very
soft
bed
nina
ivanovna
came
in
for
a
minute
she
sat
down
as
people
who
feel
guilty
sit
down
timidly
and
looking
about
her
well
tell
me
nadya
she
enquired
after
a
brief
pause
are
you
contented
quite
contented
yes
mother
nina
ivanovna
got
up
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
nadya
and
the
windows
i
have
become
religious
as
you
see
she
said
you
know
i
am
studying
philosophy
now
and
i
am
always
thinking
and
thinking
and
many
things
have
become
as
clear
as
daylight
to
me
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
above
all
necessary
is
that
life
should
pass
as
it
were
through
a
prism
tell
me
mother
how
is
granny
in
health
she
seems
all
right
when
you
went
away
that
time
with
sasha
and
the
telegram
came
from
you
granny
fell
on
the
floor
as
she
read
it
for
three
days
she
lay
without
moving
after
that
she
was
always
praying
and
crying
but
now
she
is
all
right
again
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
tick
tock
tapped
the
watchman
tick
tock
tick
tock
what
is
above
all
necessary
is
that
life
should
pass
as
it
were
through
a
prism
she
said
in
other
words
that
life
in
consciousness
should
be
analyzed
into
its
simplest
elements
as
into
the
seven
primary
colours
and
each
element
must
be
studied
separately
what
nina
ivanovna
said
further
and
when
she
went
away
nadya
did
not
hear
as
she
quickly
fell
asleep
may
passed
june
came
nadya
had
grown
used
to
being
at
home
granny
busied
herself
about
the
samovar
heaving
deep
sighs
nina
ivanovna
talked
in
the
evenings
about
her
philosophy
she
still
lived
in
the
house
like
a
poor
relation
and
had
to
go
to
granny
for
every
farthing
there
were
lots
of
flies
in
the
house
and
the
ceilings
seemed
to
become
lower
and
lower
granny
and
nina
ivanovna
did
not
go
out
in
the
streets
for
fear
of
meeting
father
andrey
and
andrey
andreitch
nadya
walked
about
the
garden
and
the
streets
looked
at
the
grey
fences
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
everything
in
the
town
had
grown
old
was
out
of
date
and
was
only
waiting
either
for
the
end
or
for
the
beginning
of
something
young
and
fresh
oh
if
only
that
new
bright
life
would
come
more
quickly
that
life
in
which
one
will
be
able
to
face
one
s
fate
boldly
and
directly
to
know
that
one
is
right
to
be
light
hearted
and
free
and
sooner
or
later
such
a
life
will
come
the
time
will
come
when
of
granny
s
house
where
things
are
so
arranged
that
the
four
servants
can
only
live
in
one
room
in
filth
in
the
basement
the
time
will
come
when
of
that
house
not
a
trace
will
remain
and
it
will
be
forgotten
no
one
will
remember
it
and
nadya
s
only
entertainment
was
from
the
boys
next
door
when
she
walked
about
the
garden
they
knocked
on
the
fence
and
shouted
in
mockery
betrothed
betrothed
a
letter
from
sasha
arrived
from
saratov
in
his
gay
dancing
handwriting
he
told
them
that
his
journey
on
the
volga
had
been
a
complete
success
but
that
he
had
been
taken
rather
ill
in
saratov
had
lost
his
voice
and
had
been
for
the
last
fortnight
in
the
hospital
she
knew
what
that
meant
and
she
was
overwhelmed
with
a
foreboding
that
was
like
a
conviction
and
it
vexed
her
that
this
foreboding
and
the
thought
of
sasha
did
not
distress
her
so
much
as
before
she
had
a
passionate
desire
for
life
longed
to
be
in
petersburg
and
her
friendship
with
sasha
seemed
now
sweet
but
something
far
far
away
she
did
not
sleep
all
night
and
in
the
morning
sat
at
the
window
listening
and
she
did
in
fact
hear
voices
below
granny
greatly
agitated
was
asking
questions
rapidly
then
some
one
began
crying
when
nadya
went
downstairs
granny
was
standing
in
the
corner
praying
before
the
ikon
and
her
face
was
tearful
a
telegram
lay
on
the
table
for
some
time
nadya
walked
up
and
down
the
room
listening
to
granny
s
weeping
then
she
picked
up
the
telegram
and
read
it
it
announced
that
the
previous
morning
alexandr
timofeitch
or
more
simply
sasha
had
died
at
saratov
of
consumption
granny
and
nina
ivanovna
went
to
the
church
to
order
a
memorial
service
while
nadya
went
on
walking
about
the
rooms
and
thinking
she
recognized
clearly
that
her
life
had
been
turned
upside
down
as
sasha
wished
that
here
she
was
alien
isolated
useless
and
that
everything
here
was
useless
to
her
that
all
the
past
had
been
torn
away
from
her
and
vanished
as
though
it
had
been
burnt
up
and
the
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds
she
went
into
sasha
s
room
and
stood
there
for
a
while
good
bye
dear
sasha
she
thought
and
before
her
mind
rose
the
vista
of
a
new
wide
spacious
life
and
that
life
still
obscure
and
full
of
mysteries
beckoned
her
and
attracted
her
she
went
upstairs
to
her
own
room
to
pack
and
next
morning
said
good
bye
to
her
family
and
full
of
life
and
high
spirits
left
the
town
as
she
supposed
for
ever
from
the
diary
of
a
violent
tempered
man
i
am
a
serious
person
and
my
mind
is
of
a
philosophic
bent
my
vocation
is
the
study
of
finance
i
am
a
student
of
financial
law
and
i
have
chosen
as
the
subject
of
my
dissertation
the
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
i
need
hardly
point
out
that
young
ladies
songs
moonlight
and
all
that
sort
of
silliness
are
entirely
out
of
my
line
morning
ten
o
clock
my
maman
pours
me
out
a
cup
of
coffee
i
drink
it
and
go
out
on
the
little
balcony
to
set
to
work
on
my
dissertation
i
take
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
dip
the
pen
into
the
ink
and
write
out
the
title
the
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
after
thinking
a
little
i
write
historical
survey
we
may
deduce
from
some
allusions
in
herodotus
and
xenophon
that
the
origin
of
the
tax
on
dogs
goes
back
to
but
at
that
point
i
hear
footsteps
that
strike
me
as
highly
suspicious
i
look
down
from
the
balcony
and
see
below
a
young
lady
with
a
long
face
and
a
long
waist
her
name
i
believe
is
nadenka
or
varenka
it
really
does
not
matter
which
she
is
looking
for
something
pretends
not
to
have
noticed
me
and
is
humming
to
herself
dost
thou
remember
that
song
full
of
tenderness
i
read
through
what
i
have
written
and
want
to
continue
but
the
young
lady
pretends
to
have
just
caught
sight
of
me
and
says
in
a
mournful
voice
good
morning
nikolay
andreitch
only
fancy
what
a
misfortune
i
have
had
i
went
for
a
walk
yesterday
and
lost
the
little
ball
off
my
bracelet
i
read
through
once
more
the
opening
of
my
dissertation
i
trim
up
the
tail
of
the
letter
g
and
mean
to
go
on
but
the
young
lady
persists
nikolay
andreitch
she
says
won
t
you
see
me
home
the
karelins
have
such
a
huge
dog
that
i
simply
daren
t
pass
it
alone
there
is
no
getting
out
of
it
i
lay
down
my
pen
and
go
down
to
her
nadenka
or
varenka
takes
my
arm
and
we
set
off
in
the
direction
of
her
villa
when
the
duty
of
walking
arm
in
arm
with
a
lady
falls
to
my
lot
for
some
reason
or
other
i
always
feel
like
a
peg
with
a
heavy
cloak
hanging
on
it
nadenka
or
varenka
between
ourselves
of
an
ardent
temperament
her
grandfather
was
an
armenian
has
a
peculiar
art
of
throwing
her
whole
weight
on
one
s
arm
and
clinging
to
one
s
side
like
a
leech
and
so
we
walk
along
as
we
pass
the
karelins
i
see
a
huge
dog
who
reminds
me
of
the
dog
licence
i
think
with
despair
of
the
work
i
have
begun
and
sigh
what
are
you
sighing
for
asks
nadenka
or
varenka
and
heaves
a
sigh
herself
here
i
must
digress
for
a
moment
to
explain
that
nadenka
or
varenka
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
believe
i
have
heard
her
called
mashenka
imagines
i
can
t
guess
why
that
i
am
in
love
with
her
and
therefore
thinks
it
her
duty
as
a
humane
person
always
to
look
at
me
with
compassion
and
to
soothe
my
wound
with
words
listen
said
she
stopping
i
know
why
you
are
sighing
you
are
in
love
yes
but
i
beg
you
for
the
sake
of
our
friendship
to
believe
that
the
girl
you
love
has
the
deepest
respect
for
you
she
can
not
return
your
love
but
is
it
her
fault
that
her
heart
has
long
been
another
s
mashenka
s
nose
begins
to
swell
and
turn
red
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
she
evidently
expects
some
answer
from
me
but
fortunately
at
this
moment
we
arrive
mashenka
s
mamma
a
good
natured
woman
but
full
of
conventional
ideas
is
sitting
on
the
terrace
glancing
at
her
daughter
s
agitated
face
she
looks
intently
at
me
and
sighs
as
though
saying
to
herself
ah
these
young
people
they
don
t
even
know
how
to
keep
their
secrets
to
themselves
on
the
terrace
with
her
are
several
young
ladies
of
various
colours
and
a
retired
officer
who
is
staying
in
the
villa
next
to
ours
he
was
wounded
during
the
last
war
in
the
left
temple
and
the
right
hip
this
unfortunate
man
is
like
myself
proposing
to
devote
the
summer
to
literary
work
he
is
writing
the
memoirs
of
a
military
man
like
me
he
begins
his
honourable
labours
every
morning
but
before
he
has
written
more
than
i
was
born
in
some
varenka
or
mashenka
is
sure
to
appear
under
his
balcony
and
the
wounded
hero
is
borne
off
under
guard
all
the
party
sitting
on
the
terrace
are
engaged
in
preparing
some
miserable
fruit
for
jam
i
make
my
bows
and
am
about
to
beat
a
retreat
but
the
young
ladies
of
various
colours
seize
my
hat
with
a
squeal
and
insist
on
my
staying
i
sit
down
they
give
me
a
plate
of
fruit
and
a
hairpin
i
begin
taking
the
seeds
out
the
young
ladies
of
various
colours
talk
about
men
they
say
that
so
and
so
is
nice
looking
that
so
and
so
is
handsome
but
not
nice
that
somebody
else
is
nice
but
ugly
and
that
a
fourth
would
not
have
been
bad
looking
if
his
nose
were
not
like
a
thimble
and
so
on
and
you
monsieur
nicolas
says
varenka
s
mamma
turning
to
me
are
not
handsome
but
you
are
attractive
there
is
something
about
your
face
in
men
though
it
s
not
beauty
but
intelligence
that
matters
she
adds
sighing
the
young
ladies
sigh
too
and
drop
their
eyes
they
agree
that
the
great
thing
in
men
is
not
beauty
but
intelligence
i
steal
a
glance
sideways
at
a
looking
glass
to
ascertain
whether
i
really
am
attractive
i
see
a
shaggy
head
a
bushy
beard
moustaches
eyebrows
hair
on
my
cheeks
hair
up
to
my
eyes
a
perfect
thicket
with
a
solid
nose
sticking
up
out
of
it
like
a
watch
tower
attractive
h
m
but
it
s
by
the
qualities
of
your
soul
after
all
that
you
will
make
your
way
nicolas
sighs
nadenka
s
mamma
as
though
affirming
some
secret
and
original
idea
of
her
own
and
nadenka
is
sympathetically
distressed
on
my
account
but
the
conviction
that
a
man
passionately
in
love
with
her
is
sitting
opposite
is
obviously
a
source
of
the
greatest
enjoyment
to
her
when
they
have
done
with
men
the
young
ladies
begin
talking
about
love
after
a
long
conversation
about
love
one
of
the
young
ladies
gets
up
and
goes
away
those
that
remain
begin
to
pick
her
to
pieces
everyone
agrees
that
she
is
stupid
unbearable
ugly
and
that
one
of
her
shoulder
blades
sticks
out
in
a
shocking
way
but
at
last
thank
goodness
i
see
our
maid
my
maman
has
sent
her
to
call
me
in
to
dinner
now
i
can
make
my
escape
from
this
uncongenial
company
and
go
back
to
my
work
i
get
up
and
make
my
bows
varenka
s
maman
varenka
herself
and
the
variegated
young
ladies
surround
me
and
declare
that
i
can
not
possibly
go
because
i
promised
yesterday
to
dine
with
them
and
go
to
the
woods
to
look
for
mushrooms
i
bow
and
sit
down
again
my
soul
is
boiling
with
rage
and
i
feel
that
in
another
moment
i
may
not
be
able
to
answer
for
myself
that
there
may
be
an
explosion
but
gentlemanly
feeling
and
the
fear
of
committing
a
breach
of
good
manners
compels
me
to
obey
the
ladies
and
i
obey
them
we
sit
down
to
dinner
the
wounded
officer
whose
wound
in
the
temple
has
affected
the
muscles
of
the
left
cheek
eats
as
though
he
had
a
bit
in
his
mouth
i
roll
up
little
balls
of
bread
think
about
the
dog
licence
and
knowing
the
ungovernable
violence
of
my
temper
try
to
avoid
speaking
nadenka
looks
at
me
sympathetically
soup
tongue
and
peas
roast
fowl
and
comp
te
i
have
no
appetite
but
eat
from
politeness
after
dinner
while
i
am
standing
alone
on
the
terrace
smoking
nadenka
s
mamma
comes
up
to
me
presses
my
hand
and
says
breathlessly
don
t
despair
nicolas
she
has
such
a
heart
such
a
heart
we
go
towards
the
wood
to
gather
mushrooms
varenka
hangs
on
my
arm
and
clings
to
my
side
my
sufferings
are
indescribable
but
i
bear
them
in
patience
we
enter
the
wood
listen
monsieur
nicolas
says
nadenka
sighing
why
are
you
so
melancholy
and
why
are
you
so
silent
extraordinary
girl
she
is
really
what
can
i
talk
to
her
about
what
have
we
in
common
oh
do
say
something
she
begs
me
i
begin
trying
to
think
of
something
popular
something
within
the
range
of
her
understanding
after
a
moment
s
thought
i
say
the
cutting
down
of
forests
has
been
greatly
detrimental
to
the
prosperity
of
russia
nicolas
sighs
nadenka
and
her
nose
begins
to
turn
red
nicolas
i
see
you
are
trying
to
avoid
being
open
with
me
you
seem
to
wish
to
punish
me
by
your
silence
your
feeling
is
not
returned
and
you
wish
to
suffer
in
silence
in
solitude
it
is
too
awful
nicolas
she
cries
impulsively
seizing
my
hand
and
i
see
her
nose
beginning
to
swell
what
would
you
say
if
the
girl
you
love
were
to
offer
you
her
eternal
friendship
i
mutter
something
incoherent
for
i
really
can
t
think
what
to
say
to
her
in
the
first
place
i
m
not
in
love
with
any
girl
at
all
in
the
second
what
could
i
possibly
want
her
eternal
friendship
for
and
thirdly
i
have
a
violent
temper
mashenka
or
varenka
hides
her
face
in
her
hands
and
murmurs
as
though
to
herself
he
will
not
speak
it
is
clear
that
he
will
have
me
make
the
sacrifice
i
can
not
love
him
if
my
heart
is
still
another
s
but
i
will
think
of
it
very
good
i
will
think
of
it
i
will
prove
the
strength
of
my
soul
and
perhaps
at
the
cost
of
my
own
happiness
i
will
save
this
man
from
suffering
i
can
make
nothing
out
of
all
this
it
seems
some
special
sort
of
puzzle
we
go
farther
into
the
wood
and
begin
picking
mushrooms
we
are
perfectly
silent
the
whole
time
nadenka
s
face
shows
signs
of
inward
struggle
i
hear
the
bark
of
dogs
it
reminds
me
of
my
dissertation
and
i
sigh
heavily
between
the
trees
i
catch
sight
of
the
wounded
officer
limping
painfully
along
the
poor
fellow
s
right
leg
is
lame
from
his
wound
and
on
his
left
arm
he
has
one
of
the
variegated
young
ladies
his
face
expresses
resignation
to
destiny
we
go
back
to
the
house
to
drink
tea
after
which
we
play
croquet
and
listen
to
one
of
the
variegated
young
ladies
singing
a
song
no
no
thou
lovest
not
no
no
at
the
word
no
she
twists
her
mouth
till
it
almost
touches
one
ear
charmant
wail
the
other
young
ladies
charmant
the
evening
comes
on
a
detestable
moon
creeps
up
behind
the
bushes
there
is
perfect
stillness
in
the
air
and
an
unpleasant
smell
of
freshly
cut
hay
i
take
up
my
hat
and
try
to
get
away
i
have
something
i
must
say
to
you
mashenka
whispers
to
me
significantly
don
t
go
away
i
have
a
foreboding
of
evil
but
politeness
obliges
me
to
remain
mashenka
takes
my
arm
and
leads
me
away
to
a
garden
walk
by
this
time
her
whole
figure
expresses
conflict
she
is
pale
and
gasping
for
breath
and
she
seems
absolutely
set
on
pulling
my
right
arm
out
of
the
socket
what
can
be
the
matter
with
her
listen
she
mutters
no
i
can
not
no
she
tries
to
say
something
but
hesitates
now
i
see
from
her
face
that
she
has
come
to
some
decision
with
gleaming
eyes
and
swollen
nose
she
snatches
my
hand
and
says
hurriedly
nicolas
i
am
yours
love
you
i
can
not
but
i
promise
to
be
true
to
you
then
she
squeezes
herself
to
my
breast
and
at
once
springs
away
someone
is
coming
she
whispers
farewell
to
morrow
at
eleven
o
clock
i
will
be
in
the
arbour
farewell
and
she
vanishes
completely
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
of
her
conduct
and
suffering
from
a
painful
palpitation
of
the
heart
i
make
my
way
home
there
the
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
is
awaiting
me
but
i
am
quite
unable
to
work
i
am
furious
i
may
say
my
anger
is
terrible
damn
it
all
i
allow
no
one
to
treat
me
like
a
boy
i
am
a
man
of
violent
temper
and
it
is
not
safe
to
trifle
with
me
when
the
maid
comes
in
to
call
me
to
supper
i
shout
to
her
go
out
of
the
room
such
hastiness
augurs
nothing
good
next
morning
typical
holiday
weather
temperature
below
freezing
a
cutting
wind
rain
mud
and
a
smell
of
naphthaline
because
my
maman
has
taken
all
her
wraps
out
of
her
trunks
a
devilish
morning
it
is
the
7th
of
august
1887
the
date
of
the
solar
eclipse
i
may
here
remark
that
at
the
time
of
an
eclipse
every
one
of
us
may
without
special
astronomical
knowledge
be
of
the
greatest
service
thus
for
example
anyone
of
us
can
1
take
the
measurement
of
the
diameters
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
2
sketch
the
corona
of
the
sun
3
take
the
temperature
4
take
observations
of
plants
and
animals
during
the
eclipse
5
note
down
his
own
impressions
and
so
on
it
is
a
matter
of
such
exceptional
importance
that
i
lay
aside
the
past
and
future
of
the
dog
licence
and
make
up
my
mind
to
observe
the
eclipse
we
all
get
up
very
early
and
i
divide
the
work
as
follows
i
am
to
measure
the
diameter
of
the
sun
and
moon
the
wounded
officer
is
to
sketch
the
corona
and
the
other
observations
are
undertaken
by
mashenka
and
the
variegated
young
ladies
we
all
meet
together
and
wait
what
is
the
cause
of
the
eclipse
asks
mashenka
i
reply
a
solar
eclipse
occurs
when
the
moon
moving
in
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
crosses
the
line
joining
the
centres
of
the
sun
and
the
earth
and
what
does
the
ecliptic
mean
i
explain
mashenka
listens
attentively
can
one
see
through
the
smoked
glass
the
line
joining
the
centres
of
the
sun
and
the
earth
she
enquires
i
reply
that
this
is
only
an
imaginary
line
drawn
theoretically
if
it
is
only
an
imaginary
line
how
can
the
moon
cross
it
varenka
says
wondering
i
make
no
reply
i
feel
my
spleen
rising
at
this
na
ve
question
it
s
all
nonsense
says
mashenka
s
maman
impossible
to
tell
what
s
going
to
happen
you
ve
never
been
in
the
sky
so
what
can
you
know
of
what
is
to
happen
with
the
sun
and
moon
it
s
all
fancy
at
that
moment
a
black
patch
begins
to
move
over
the
sun
general
confusion
follows
the
sheep
and
horses
and
cows
run
bellowing
about
the
fields
with
their
tails
in
the
air
the
dogs
howl
the
bugs
thinking
night
has
come
on
creep
out
of
the
cracks
in
the
walls
and
bite
the
people
who
are
still
in
bed
the
deacon
who
was
engaged
in
bringing
some
cucumbers
from
the
market
garden
jumped
out
of
his
cart
and
hid
under
the
bridge
while
his
horse
walked
off
into
somebody
else
s
yard
where
the
pigs
ate
up
all
the
cucumbers
the
excise
officer
who
had
not
slept
at
home
that
night
but
at
a
lady
friend
s
dashed
out
with
nothing
on
but
his
nightshirt
and
running
into
the
crowd
shouted
frantically
save
yourself
if
you
can
numbers
of
the
lady
visitors
even
young
and
pretty
ones
run
out
of
their
villas
without
even
putting
their
slippers
on
scenes
occur
which
i
hesitate
to
describe
oh
how
dreadful
shriek
the
variegated
young
ladies
it
s
really
too
awful
mesdames
watch
i
cry
time
is
precious
and
i
hasten
to
measure
the
diameters
i
remember
the
corona
and
look
towards
the
wounded
officer
he
stands
doing
nothing
what
s
the
matter
i
shout
how
about
the
corona
he
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
looks
helplessly
towards
his
arms
the
poor
fellow
has
variegated
young
ladies
on
both
sides
of
him
clinging
to
him
in
terror
and
preventing
him
from
working
i
seize
a
pencil
and
note
down
the
time
to
a
second
that
is
of
great
importance
i
note
down
the
geographical
position
of
the
point
of
observation
that
too
is
of
importance
i
am
just
about
to
measure
the
diameter
when
mashenka
seizes
my
hand
and
says
do
not
forget
to
day
eleven
o
clock
i
withdraw
my
hand
feeling
every
second
precious
try
to
continue
my
observations
but
varenka
clutches
my
arm
and
clings
to
me
pencil
pieces
of
glass
drawings
all
are
scattered
on
the
grass
hang
it
it
s
high
time
the
girl
realized
that
i
am
a
man
of
violent
temper
and
when
i
am
roused
my
fury
knows
no
bounds
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
i
try
to
continue
but
the
eclipse
is
over
look
at
me
she
whispers
tenderly
oh
that
is
the
last
straw
trying
a
man
s
patience
like
that
can
but
have
a
fatal
ending
i
am
not
to
blame
if
something
terrible
happens
i
allow
no
one
to
make
a
laughing
stock
of
me
and
god
knows
when
i
am
furious
i
advise
nobody
to
come
near
me
damn
it
all
there
s
nothing
i
might
not
do
one
of
the
young
ladies
probably
noticing
from
my
face
what
a
rage
i
am
in
and
anxious
to
propitiate
me
says
i
did
exactly
what
you
told
me
nikolay
andreitch
i
watched
the
animals
i
saw
the
grey
dog
chasing
the
cat
just
before
the
eclipse
and
wagging
his
tail
for
a
long
while
afterwards
so
nothing
came
of
the
eclipse
after
all
i
go
home
thanks
to
the
rain
i
work
indoors
instead
of
on
the
balcony
the
wounded
officer
has
risked
it
and
has
again
got
as
far
as
i
was
born
in
when
i
see
one
of
the
variegated
young
ladies
pounce
down
on
him
and
bear
him
off
to
her
villa
i
can
not
work
for
i
am
still
in
a
fury
and
suffering
from
palpitation
of
the
heart
i
do
not
go
to
the
arbour
it
is
impolite
not
to
but
after
all
i
can
t
be
expected
to
go
in
the
rain
at
twelve
o
clock
i
receive
a
letter
from
mashenka
a
letter
full
of
reproaches
and
entreaties
to
go
to
the
arbour
addressing
me
as
thou
at
one
o
clock
i
get
a
second
letter
and
at
two
a
third
i
must
go
but
before
going
i
must
consider
what
i
am
to
say
to
her
i
will
behave
like
a
gentleman
to
begin
with
i
will
tell
her
that
she
is
mistaken
in
supposing
that
i
am
in
love
with
her
that
s
a
thing
one
does
not
say
to
a
lady
as
a
rule
though
to
tell
a
lady
that
one
s
not
in
love
with
her
is
almost
as
rude
as
to
tell
an
author
he
can
t
write
the
best
thing
will
be
to
explain
my
views
of
marriage
i
put
on
my
winter
overcoat
take
an
umbrella
and
walk
to
the
arbour
knowing
the
hastiness
of
my
temper
i
am
afraid
i
may
be
led
into
speaking
too
strongly
i
will
try
to
restrain
myself
i
find
nadenka
still
waiting
for
me
she
is
pale
and
in
tears
on
seeing
me
she
utters
a
cry
of
joy
flings
herself
on
my
neck
and
says
at
last
you
are
trying
my
patience
listen
i
have
not
slept
all
night
i
have
been
thinking
and
thinking
i
believe
that
when
i
come
to
know
you
better
i
shall
learn
to
love
you
i
sit
down
and
begin
to
unfold
my
views
of
marriage
to
begin
with
to
clear
the
ground
of
digressions
and
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
i
open
with
a
short
historical
survey
i
speak
of
marriage
in
ancient
egypt
and
india
then
pass
to
more
recent
times
a
few
ideas
from
schopenhauer
mashenka
listens
attentively
but
all
of
a
sudden
through
some
strange
incoherence
of
ideas
thinks
fit
to
interrupt
me
nicolas
kiss
me
she
says
i
am
embarrassed
and
don
t
know
what
to
say
to
her
she
repeats
her
request
there
seems
no
avoiding
it
i
get
up
and
bend
over
her
long
face
feeling
as
i
do
so
just
as
i
did
in
my
childhood
when
i
was
lifted
up
to
kiss
my
grandmother
in
her
coffin
not
content
with
the
kiss
mashenka
leaps
up
and
impulsively
embraces
me
at
that
instant
mashenka
s
maman
appears
in
the
doorway
of
the
arbour
she
makes
a
face
as
though
in
alarm
and
saying
sh
sh
to
someone
with
her
vanishes
like
mephistopheles
through
the
trapdoor
confused
and
enraged
i
return
to
our
villa
at
home
i
find
varenka
s
maman
embracing
my
maman
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
my
maman
weeps
and
says
i
always
hoped
for
it
and
then
if
you
please
nadenka
s
maman
comes
up
to
me
embraces
me
and
says
may
god
bless
you
mind
you
love
her
well
remember
the
sacrifice
she
is
making
for
your
sake
and
here
i
am
at
my
wedding
at
the
moment
i
write
these
last
words
my
best
man
is
at
my
side
urging
me
to
make
haste
these
people
have
no
idea
of
my
character
i
have
a
violent
temper
i
can
not
always
answer
for
myself
hang
it
all
god
knows
what
will
come
of
it
to
lead
a
violent
desperate
man
to
the
altar
is
as
unwise
as
to
thrust
one
s
hand
into
the
cage
of
a
ferocious
tiger
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
and
so
i
am
married
everybody
congratulates
me
and
varenka
keeps
clinging
to
me
and
saying
now
you
are
mine
mine
do
you
understand
that
tell
me
that
you
love
me
and
her
nose
swells
as
she
says
it
i
learn
from
my
best
man
that
the
wounded
officer
has
very
cleverly
escaped
the
snares
of
hymen
he
showed
the
variegated
young
lady
a
medical
certificate
that
owing
to
the
wound
in
his
temple
he
was
at
times
mentally
deranged
and
incapable
of
contracting
a
valid
marriage
an
inspiration
i
might
have
got
a
certificate
too
an
uncle
of
mine
drank
himself
to
death
another
uncle
was
extremely
absent
minded
on
one
occasion
he
put
a
lady
s
muff
on
his
head
in
mistake
for
his
hat
an
aunt
of
mine
played
a
great
deal
on
the
piano
and
used
to
put
out
her
tongue
at
gentlemen
she
did
not
like
and
my
ungovernable
temper
is
a
very
suspicious
symptom
but
why
do
these
great
ideas
always
come
too
late
why
in
the
dark
a
fly
of
medium
size
made
its
way
into
the
nose
of
the
assistant
procurator
gagin
it
may
have
been
impelled
by
curiosity
or
have
got
there
through
frivolity
or
accident
in
the
dark
anyway
the
nose
resented
the
presence
of
a
foreign
body
and
gave
the
signal
for
a
sneeze
gagin
sneezed
sneezed
impressively
and
so
shrilly
and
loudly
that
the
bed
shook
and
the
springs
creaked
gagin
s
wife
marya
mihalovna
a
full
plump
fair
woman
started
too
and
woke
up
she
gazed
into
the
darkness
sighed
and
turned
over
on
the
other
side
five
minutes
afterwards
she
turned
over
again
and
shut
her
eyes
more
firmly
but
she
could
not
get
to
sleep
again
after
sighing
and
tossing
from
side
to
side
for
a
time
she
got
up
crept
over
her
husband
and
putting
on
her
slippers
went
to
the
window
it
was
dark
outside
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
outlines
of
the
trees
and
the
roof
of
the
stables
there
was
a
faint
pallor
in
the
east
but
this
pallor
was
beginning
to
be
clouded
over
there
was
perfect
stillness
in
the
air
wrapped
in
slumber
and
darkness
even
the
watchman
paid
to
disturb
the
stillness
of
night
was
silent
even
the
corncrake
the
only
wild
creature
of
the
feathered
tribe
that
does
not
shun
the
proximity
of
summer
visitors
was
silent
the
stillness
was
broken
by
marya
mihalovna
herself
standing
at
the
window
and
gazing
into
the
yard
she
suddenly
uttered
a
cry
she
fancied
that
from
the
flower
garden
with
the
gaunt
clipped
poplar
a
dark
figure
was
creeping
towards
the
house
for
the
first
minute
she
thought
it
was
a
cow
or
a
horse
then
rubbing
her
eyes
she
distinguished
clearly
the
outlines
of
a
man
then
she
fancied
the
dark
figure
approached
the
window
of
the
kitchen
and
standing
still
a
moment
apparently
undecided
put
one
foot
on
the
window
ledge
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
window
a
burglar
flashed
into
her
mind
and
a
deathly
pallor
overspread
her
face
and
in
one
instant
her
imagination
had
drawn
the
picture
so
dreaded
by
lady
visitors
in
country
places
a
burglar
creeps
into
the
kitchen
from
the
kitchen
into
the
dining
room
the
silver
in
the
cupboard
next
into
the
bedroom
an
axe
the
face
of
a
brigand
jewelry
her
knees
gave
way
under
her
and
a
shiver
ran
down
her
back
vassya
she
said
shaking
her
husband

vassily
prokovitch

might
be

the
assistant

with
a
deep
inward

and
a
munching
sound

sake

a
burglar

got
into
the
kitchen

standing
at

the
assistant
procurator
slowly
got
up
and
sat
on
the
bed
filling
the
air
with
loud
yawns
goodness
knows
what
creatures
women
are
he
muttered

cursed
again
and
set
off
to
the
kitchen
it
was
as
dark
as
the
inside
of
a
barrel
and
the
assistant
procurator
had
to
feel
his
way
he
groped
his
way
to
the
door
of
the
nursery
and
waked
the
nurse
vassilissa
he
said

box
under

shelf
of
saucepans
the

pelagea
and
he
could
hear
the
tears
in
her
voice
gentlefolks
educated
and
yet
not
a
notion
that
with
our
hard
lot
in
our
life
of
toil

into
tears

easy
to
insult

for

don
t

mistress

a
devil
in
at
the
window
for
all
i
care
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
assistant
procurator
but
to
acknowledge
himself
in
the
wrong
and
go
back
to
his
spouse
i
say
pelagea
he
said
you
had
my
dressing
gown

felt
for

dressing
gown
by
the
stove

it
on
and
went
quietly
back
to
his
room
when
her
husband
went
out
marya
mihalovna
got
into
bed
and
waited
for
the
first
three
minutes
her
mind
was
at
rest
but
after
that
she
began
to
feel
uneasy
what
a
long
time
he
s
gone
she
thought
it
s
all
right
if
he
is
there
that
immoral
man
but
if
it
s
a
burglar
and
again
her
imagination
drew
a
picture
of
her
husband
going
into
the
dark
kitchen
a
blow
with
an
axe
dying
without
uttering
a
single
sound
a
pool
of
blood
five
minutes
passed
five
and
a
half
at
last
six
a
cold
sweat
came
out
on
her
forehead
basile
she
shrieked
basile
what
are
you
shouting
for

am
here
she
heard
her
husband
s
voice
and
steps

you
being
murdered
the
assistant
procurator
went
up
to
the
bedstead
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
it
there

nobody
there
at
all
he
said
it
was
your
fancy
you
queer

as
virtuous
as
her
mistress
what

coward

and
the
deputy
procurator
began
teasing
his
wife
he
was
wide
awake
now
and
did
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
again
you
are
a
coward
he
laughed

to
the
doctor
to

and

hallucinations

are
a
neurotic
what

with
his
autograph
gagin
struck
a
match
against
the
wall
and
lighted
a
candle
but
before
he
had
moved
a
step
from
the
bed
to
fetch
the
photographs
he
heard
behind
him
a
piercing
heartrending
shriek
looking
round
he
saw
his
wife
s
large
eyes
fastened
upon
him
full
of
amazement
horror
and
wrath
you
took
your
dressing
gown
off
in
the
kitchen
she
said
turning
pale
why
look
at
yourself
the
deputy
procurator
looked
down
at
himself
and
gasped
flung
over
his
shoulders
was
not
his
dressing
gown
but
the
fireman
s
overcoat
how
had
it
come
on
his
shoulders
while
he
was
settling
that
question
his
wife
s
imagination
was
drawing
another
picture
awful
and
impossible
darkness
stillness
whispering
and
so
on
and
so
on
a
play
pavel
vassilyevitch
there

a
lady

announced
she

been
waiting
a
good
hour
pavel
vassilyevitch

only
just
finished

of
the
lady
he
frowned
and
said
oh

times
already
pavel
vassilyevitch
she

almost
crying

m
very
well
then

into
the
study
without
haste
pavel
vassilyevitch
put
on
his
coat
took
a
pen
in
one
hand
and
a
book
in
the
other
and
trying
to
look
as
though
he
were
very
busy
he
went
into
the
study
there
the
visitor
was
awaiting
him
a
large
stout
lady
with
a
red
beefy
face
in
spectacles
she
looked
very
respectable
and
her
dress
was
more
than
fashionable
she
had
on
a
crinolette
of
four
storeys
and
a
high
hat
with
a
reddish
bird
in
it
on
seeing
him
she
turned
up
her
eyes
and
folded
her
hands
in
supplication
you
don
t
remember
me
of
course
she
began
in
a
high
masculine
tenor
visibly
agitated

authoress

i

added
my
little
quota
i
have
published
at
different
times
three
stories

play
my

and
before

to
the
censor
i
should
like
above
all
things
to
have
your
opinion
on
it
nervously
with
the
flutter
of
a
captured
bird
the
lady
fumbled
in
her
skirt
and
drew
out
a
fat
manuscript
pavel
vassilyevitch
liked
no
articles
but
his
own
when
threatened
with
the
necessity
of
reading
other
people
s
or
listening
to
them
he
felt
as
though
he
were
facing
the
cannon
s
mouth
seeing
the
manuscript
he
took
fright
and
hastened
to
say
very
good
leave
it
i
ll
read
it
pavel
vassilyevitch
the
lady
said
languishingly
clasping
her
hands
and
raising
them
in
supplication
i
know
you
re
busy

every
minute

faltered
pavel
vassilyevitch
but
madam
i
m
i
m
very
busy
i
m
i
m
obliged
to
set
off
this
minute
pavel
vassilyevitch
moaned
the
lady
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
m
asking
a
sacrifice
i
am
insolent
i
am
intrusive
but
be
magnanimous
to

and
i
should
like
to
know
your
opinion
to
day
grant
me
half
an
hour
of
your
attention
only
one
half
hour
i
implore
you
pavel
vassilyevitch
was
cotton
wool
at
core
and
could
not
refuse
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
lady
was
about
to
burst
into
sobs
and
fall
on
her
knees
he
was
overcome
with
confusion
and
muttered
helplessly
very
well
certainly
i
will
listen
i
will
give
you
half
an
hour
the
lady
uttered
a
shriek
of
joy
took
off
her
hat
and
settling
herself
began
to
read
at
first
she
read
a
scene
in
which
a
footman
and
a
house
maid
tidying
up
a
sumptuous
drawing
room
talked
at
length
about
their
young
lady
anna
sergyevna
who
was
building
a
school
and
a
hospital
in
the
village
when
the
footman
had
left
the
room
the
maidservant
pronounced
a
monologue
to
the
effect
that
education
is
light
and
ignorance
is
darkness
then
mme
murashkin
brought
the
footman
back
into
the
drawing
room
and
set
him
uttering
a
long
monologue
concerning
his
master
the
general
who
disliked
his
daughter
s
views
intended
to
marry
her
to
a
rich
kammer
junker
and
held
that
the
salvation
of
the
people
lay
in
unadulterated
ignorance
then
when
the
servants
had
left
the
stage
the
young
lady
herself
appeared
and
informed
the
audience
that
she
had
not
slept
all
night
but
had
been
thinking
of
valentin
ivanovitch
who
was
the
son
of
a
poor
teacher
and
assisted
his
sick
father
gratuitously
valentin
had
studied
all
the
sciences
but
had
no
faith
in
friendship
nor
in
love
he
had
no
object
in
life
and
longed
for
death
and
therefore
she
the
young
lady
must
save
him
pavel
vassilyevitch
listened
and
thought
with
yearning
anguish
of
his
sofa
he
scanned
the
lady
viciously
felt
her
masculine
tenor
thumping
on
his
eardrums
understood
nothing
and
thought
the
devil
sent
you
as
though
i
wanted
to
listen
to
your
tosh
it
s
not
my
fault
you
ve
written
a
play
is
it
my
god
what
a
thick
manuscript
what
an
infliction
pavel
vassilyevitch
glanced
at
the
wall
where
the
portrait
of
his
wife
was
hanging
and
remembered
that
his
wife
had
asked
him
to
buy
and
bring
to
their
summer
cottage
five
yards
of
tape
a
pound
of
cheese
and
some
tooth
powder
i
hope
i
ve
not
lost
the
pattern
of
that
tape
he
thought
where
did
i
put
it
i
believe
it
s
in
my
blue
reefer
jacket
those
wretched
flies
have
covered
her
portrait
with
spots
already
i
must
tell
olga
to
wash
the
glass
she
s
reading
the
twelfth
scene
so
we
must
soon
be
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
as
though
inspiration
were
possible
in
this
heat
and
with
such
a
mountain
of
flesh
too
instead
of
writing
plays
she
d
much
better
eat
cold
vinegar
hash
and
sleep
in
a
cellar
you
don
t
think
that
monologue
s
a
little
too
long
the
lady
asked
suddenly
raising
her
eyes
pavel
vassilyevitch
had
not
heard
the
monologue
and
said
in
a
voice
as
guilty
as
though
not
the
lady
but
he
had
written
that
monologue
no
no
not
at
all
it
s
very
nice
the
lady
beamed
with
happiness
and
continued
reading
anna
you
are
consumed
by
analysis
too
early
you
have
ceased
to
live
in
the
heart
and
have
put
your
faith
in
the
intellect
valentin
what
do
you
mean
by
the
heart
that
is
a
concept
of
anatomy
as
a
conventional
term
for
what
are
called
the
feelings
i
do
not
admit
it
anna
confused
and
love
surely
that
is
not
merely
a
product
of
the
association
of
ideas
tell
me
frankly
have
you
ever
loved
valentin
bitterly
let
us
not
touch
on
old
wounds
not
yet
healed
a
pause
what
are
you
thinking
of
anna
i
believe
you
are
unhappy
during
the
sixteenth
scene
pavel
vassilyevitch
yawned
and
accidently
made
with
his
teeth
the
sound
dogs
make
when
they
catch
a
fly
he
was
dismayed
at
this
unseemly
sound
and
to
cover
it
assumed
an
expression
of
rapt
attention
scene
seventeen
when
will
it
end
he
thought
oh
my
god
if
this
torture
is
prolonged
another
ten
minutes
i
shall
shout
for
the
police
it
s
insufferable
but
at
last
the
lady
began
reading
more
loudly
and
more
rapidly
and
finally
raising
her
voice
she
read
curtain
pavel
vassilyevitch
uttered
a
faint
sigh
and
was
about
to
get
up
but
the
lady
promptly
turned
the

went

vassilyevitch
broke
in
how
many
acts
are
there
five
answered
the
lady
and
at
once
as
though
fearing
her
audience
might
escape
her
she
went
on
rapidly
valentin
is
looking
out
of
the
schoolhouse
window
in
the
background
villagers
can
be
seen
taking
their
goods
to
the
inn
like
a
man
condemned
to
be
executed
and
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
a
reprieve
pavel
vassilyevitch
gave
up
expecting
the
end
abandoned
all
hope
and
simply
tried
to
prevent
his
eyes
from
closing
and
to
retain
an
expression
of
attention
on
his
face
the
future
when
the
lady
would
finish
her
play
and
depart
seemed
to
him
so
remote
that
he
did
not
even
think
of
it

sounded

pavel
vassilyevitch
made
an
effort
to
unglue
his
strained
and
closing
eyelids
yawned
without
opening
his
mouth
and
stared
at
mme
murashkin
she
grew
misty
and
swayed
before
his
eyes
turned
into
a
triangle
and
her
head
pressed
against
the
ceiling
valentin
no
let
me
depart

in
dismay

turned

die
than
you
should
know
the
reason

after
a
pause
you
can
not
go
away
the
lady
began
to
swell
swelled
to
an
immense
size
and
melted
into
the
dingy
atmosphere
of
the
study
only
her
moving
mouth
was
visible
then
she
suddenly
dwindled
to
the
size
of
a
bottle
swayed
from
side
to
side
and
with
the
table
retreated
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
valentin
holding
anna
in
his
arms
you

given

you
have

it
is
too
late
too
late
the
ill
that
gnaws
at
my
heart
is
beyond
cure
pavel
vassilyevitch
started
and
with
dim
and
smarting
eyes
stared
at
the
reading
lady
for
a
minute
he
gazed
fixedly
as
though
understanding
nothing

the
lady
began
swelling
again
looking
round
him
wildly
pavel
vassilyevitch
got
up
yelled
in
a
deep
unnatural
voice
snatched
from
the
table
a
heavy
paper
weight
and
beside
himself
brought
it
down
with
all
his
force
on
the
authoress
s
head
give
me
in
charge
i
ve
killed
her
he
said
to
the
maidservant
who
ran
in
a
minute
later
the
jury
acquitted
him
a
mystery
on
the
evening
of
easter
sunday
the
actual
civil
councillor
navagin
on
his
return
from
paying
calls
picked
up
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
visitors
had
inscribed
their
names
in
the
hall
and
went
with
it
into
his
study
after
taking
off
his
outer
garments
and
drinking
some
seltzer
water
he
settled
himself
comfortably
on
a
couch
and
began
reading
the
signatures
in
the
list
when
his
eyes
reached
the
middle
of
the
long
list
of
signatures
he
started
gave
an
ejaculation
of
astonishment
and
snapped
his
fingers
while
his
face
expressed
the
utmost
perplexity
again
he
said
slapping
his
knee
it
s
extraordinary
again
again
there
is
the
signature
of
that
fellow
goodness
knows
who
he
is
fedyukov
again
among
the
numerous
signatures
on
the
paper
was
the
signature
of
a
certain
fedyukov
who
the
devil
this
fedyukov
was
navagin
had
not
a
notion
he
went
over
in
his
memory
all
his
acquaintances
relations
and
subordinates
in
the
service
recalled
his
remote
past
but
could
recollect
no
name
like
fedyukov
what
was
so
strange
was
that
this
incognito
fedyukov
had
signed
his
name
regularly
every
christmas
and
easter
for
the
last
thirteen
years
neither
navagin
his
wife
nor
his
house
porter
knew
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
or
what
he
was
like
it
s
extraordinary
navagin
thought
in
perplexity
as
he
paced
about
the
study
it
s
strange
and
incomprehensible
it
s
like
sorcery
call
the
porter
here
he
shouted
it
s
devilish
queer
but
i
will
find
out
who
he
is
i
say
grigory
he
said
addressing
the
porter
as
he
entered
that
fedyukov
has
signed
his
name
again
did
you
see
him
no
your
excellency
upon
my
word
but
he
has
signed
his
name
so
he
must
have
been
in
the
hall
has
he
been
no
he
hasn
t
your
excellency
how
could
he
have
signed
his
name
without
being
there
i
can
t
tell
who
is
to
tell
then
you
sit
gaping
there
in
the
hall
try
and
remember
perhaps
someone
you
didn
t
know
came
in
think
a
minute
no
your
excellency
there
has
been
no
one
i
didn
t
know
our
clerks
have
been
the
baroness
came
to
see
her
excellency
the
priests
have
been
with
the
cross
and
there
has
been
no
one
else
why
he
was
invisible
when
he
signed
his
name
then
was
he
i
can
t
say
but
there
has
been
no
fedyukov
here
that
i
will
swear
before
the
holy
image
it
s
queer
it
s
incomprehensible
it
s
ex
traordinary
mused
navagin
it
s
positively
ludicrous
a
man
has
been
signing
his
name
here
for
thirteen
years
and
you
can
t
find
out
who
he
is
perhaps
it
s
a
joke
perhaps
some
clerk
writes
that
name
as
well
as
his
own
for
fun
and
navagin
began
examining
fedyukov
s
signature
the
bold
florid
signature
in
the
old
fashioned
style
with
twirls
and
flourishes
was
utterly
unlike
the
handwriting
of
the
other
signatures
it
was
next
below
the
signature
of
shtutchkin
the
provincial
secretary
a
scared
timorous
little
man
who
would
certainly
have
died
of
fright
if
he
had
ventured
upon
such
an
impudent
joke
the
mysterious
fedyukov
has
signed
his
name
again
said
navagin
going
in
to
see
his
wife
again
i
fail
to
find
out
who
he
is
madame
navagin
was
a
spiritualist
and
so
for
all
phenomena
in
nature
comprehensible
or
incomprehensible
she
had
a
very
simple
explanation
there
s
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
she
said
you
don
t
believe
it
of
course
but
i
have
said
it
already
and
i
say
it
again
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
world
that
is
supernatural
which
our
feeble
intellect
can
never
grasp
i
am
convinced
that
this
fedyukov
is
a
spirit
who
has
a
sympathy
for
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
call
him
up
and
ask
him
what
he
wants
nonsense
nonsense
navagin
was
free
from
superstitions
but
the
phenomenon
which
interested
him
was
so
mysterious
that
all
sorts
of
uncanny
devilry
intruded
into
his
mind
against
his
will
all
the
evening
he
was
imagining
that
the
incognito
fedyukov
was
the
spirit
of
some
long
dead
clerk
who
had
been
discharged
from
the
service
by
navagin
s
ancestors
and
was
now
revenging
himself
on
their
descendant
or
perhaps
it
was
the
kinsman
of
some
petty
official
dismissed
by
navagin
himself
or
of
a
girl
seduced
by
him
all
night
navagin
dreamed
of
a
gaunt
old
clerk
in
a
shabby
uniform
with
a
face
as
yellow
as
a
lemon
hair
that
stood
up
like
a
brush
and
pewtery
eyes
the
clerk
said
something
in
a
sepulchral
voice
and
shook
a
bony
finger
at
him
and
navagin
almost
had
an
attack
of
inflammation
of
the
brain
for
a
fortnight
he
was
silent
and
gloomy
and
kept
walking
up
and
down
and
thinking
in
the
end
he
overcame
his
sceptical
vanity
and
going
into
his
wife
s
room
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
zina
call
up
fedyukov
the
spiritualistic
lady
was
delighted
she
sent
for
a
sheet
of
cardboard
and
a
saucer
made
her
husband
sit
down
beside
her
and
began
upon
the
magic
rites
fedyukov
did
not
keep
them
waiting
long
what
do
you
want
asked
navagin
repent
answered
the
saucer
what
were
you
on
earth
a
sinner
there
you
see
whispered
his
wife
and
you
did
not
believe
navagin
conversed
for
a
long
time
with
fedyukov
and
then
called
up
napoleon
hannibal
askotchensky
his
aunt
klavdya
zaharovna
and
they
all
gave
him
brief
but
correct
answers
full
of
deep
significance
he
was
busy
with
the
saucer
for
four
hours
and
fell
asleep
soothed
and
happy
that
he
had
become
acquainted
with
a
mysterious
world
that
was
new
to
him
after
that
he
studied
spiritualism
every
day
and
at
the
office
informed
the
clerks
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
nature
that
was
supernatural
and
marvellous
to
which
our
men
of
science
ought
to
have
turned
their
attention
long
ago
hypnotism
mediumism
bishopism
spiritualism
the
fourth
dimension
and
other
misty
notions
took
complete
possession
of
him
so
that
for
whole
days
at
a
time
to
the
great
delight
of
his
wife
he
read
books
on
spiritualism
or
devoted
himself
to
the
saucer
table
turning
and
discussions
of
supernatural
phenomena
at
his
instigation
all
his
clerks
took
up
spiritualism
too
and
with
such
ardour
that
the
old
managing
clerk
went
out
of
his
mind
and
one
day
sent
a
telegram
hell
government
house
i
feel
that
i
am
turning
into
an
evil
spirit
what
s
to
be
done
reply
paid
vassily
krinolinsky
after
reading
several
hundreds
of
treatises
on
spiritualism
navagin
had
a
strong
desire
to
write
something
himself
for
five
months
he
sat
composing
and
in
the
end
had
written
a
huge
monograph
entitled
my
opinion
when
he
had
finished
this
essay
he
determined
to
send
it
to
a
spiritualist
journal
the
day
on
which
it
was
intended
to
despatch
it
to
the
journal
was
a
very
memorable
one
for
him
navagin
remembers
that
on
that
never
to
be
forgotten
day
the
secretary
who
had
made
a
fair
copy
of
his
article
and
the
sacristan
of
the
parish
who
had
been
sent
for
on
business
were
in
his
study
navagin
s
face
was
beaming
he
looked
lovingly
at
his
creation
felt
between
his
fingers
how
thick
it
was
and
with
a
happy
smile
said
to
the
secretary
i
propose
filipp
sergeyitch
to
send
it
registered
it
will
be
safer
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
sacristan
he
said
i
have
sent
for
you
on
business
my
good
man
i
am
putting
my
youngest
son
to
the
high
school
and
i
must
have
a
certificate
of
baptism
only
could
you
let
me
have
it
quickly
very
good
your
excellency
said
the
sacristan
bowing
very
good
i
understand
can
you
let
me
have
it
by
to
morrow
very
well
your
excellency
set
your
mind
at
rest
to
morrow
it
shall
be
ready
will
you
send
someone
to
the
church
to
morrow
before
evening
service
i
shall
be
there
bid
him
ask
for
fedyukov
i
am
always
there
what
cried
the
general
turning
pale
fedyukov
you
you
are
fedyukov
asked
navagin
looking
at
him
with
wide
open
eyes
just
so
fedyukov
you
you
signed
your
name
in
my
hall
yes
the
sacristan
admitted
and
was
overcome
with
confusion
when
we
come
with
the
cross
your
excellency
to
grand
gentlemen
s
houses
i
always
sign
my
name
i
like
doing
it
excuse
me
but
when
i
see
the
list
of
names
in
the
hall
i
feel
an
impulse
to
sign
mine
in
dumb
stupefaction
understanding
nothing
hearing
nothing
navagin
paced
about
his
study
he
touched
the
curtain
over
the
door
three
times
waved
his
hands
like
a
jeune
premier
in
a
ballet
when
he
sees
her
gave
a
whistle
and
a
meaningless
smile
and
pointed
with
his
finger
into
space
so
i
will
send
off
the
article
at
once
your
excellency
said
the
secretary
these
words
roused
navagin
from
his
stupour
he
looked
blankly
at
the
secretary
and
the
sacristan
remembered
and
stamping
his
foot
irritably
screamed
in
a
high
breaking
tenor
leave
me
in
peace
lea
eave
me
in
peace
i
tell
you
what
you
want
of
me
i
don
t
understand
the
secretary
and
the
sacristan
went
out
of
the
study
and
reached
the
street
while
he
was
still
stamping
and
shouting
leave
me
in
peace
what
you
want
of
me
i
don
t
understand

in

strong
impressions
it
happened
not
so
long
ago
in
the
moscow
circuit
court
the
jurymen
left
in
the
court
for
the
night
before
lying
down
to
sleep
fell
into
conversation
about
strong
impressions
they
were
led
to
this
discussion
by
recalling
a
witness
who
by
his
own
account
had
begun
to
stammer
and
had
gone
grey
owing
to
a
terrible
moment
the
jurymen
decided
that
before
going
to
sleep
each
one
of
them
should
ransack
among
his
memories
and
tell
something
that
had
happened
to
him
man
s
life
is
brief
but
yet
there
is
no
man
who
can
not
boast
that
there
have
been
terrible
moments
in
his
past
one
juryman
told
the
story
of
how
he
was
nearly
drowned
another
described
how
in
a
place
where
there
were
neither
doctors
nor
chemists
he
had
one
night
poisoned
his
own
son
through
giving
him
zinc
vitriol
by
mistake
for
soda
the
child
did
not
die
but
the
father
nearly
went
out
of
his
mind
a
third
a
man
not
old
but
in
bad
health
told
how
he
had
twice
attempted
to
commit
suicide
the
first
time
by
shooting
himself
and
the
second
time
by
throwing
himself
before
a
train
the
fourth
a
foppishly
dressed
fat
little
man
told
us
the
following
story
i
was
not
more
than
twenty
two
or
twenty
three
when
i
fell
head
over
ears
in
love
with
my
present
wife
and
made
her
an
offer
now
i
could
with
pleasure
thrash
myself
for
my
early
marriage
but
at
the
time
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
natasha
had
refused
me
my
love
was
absolutely
the
real
thing
just
as
it
is
described
in
novels
frantic
passionate
and
so
on
my
happiness
overwhelmed
me
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
get
away
from
it
and
i
bored
my
father
and
my
friends
and
the
servants
continually
talking
about
the
fervour
of
my
passion
happy
people
are
the
most
sickening
bores
i
was
a
fearful
bore
i
feel
ashamed
of
it
even
now
among
my
friends
there
was
in
those
days
a
young
man
who
was
beginning
his
career
as
a
lawyer
now
he
is
a
lawyer
known
all
over
russia
in
those
days
he
was
only
just
beginning
to
gain
recognition
and
was
not
rich
and
famous
enough
to
be
entitled
to
cut
an
old
friend
when
he
met
him
i
used
to
go
and
see
him
once
or
twice
a
week
we
used
to
loll
on
sofas
and
begin
discussing
philosophy
one
day
i
was
lying
on
his
sofa
arguing
that
there
was
no
more
ungrateful
profession
than
that
of
a
lawyer
i
tried
to
prove
that
as
soon
as
the
examination
of
witnesses
is
over
the
court
can
easily
dispense
with
both
the
counsels
for
the
prosecution
and
for
the
defence
because
they
are
neither
of
them
necessary
and
are
only
in
the
way
if
a
grown
up
juryman
morally
and
mentally
sane
is
convinced
that
the
ceiling
is
white
or
that
ivanov
is
guilty
to
struggle
with
that
conviction
and
to
vanquish
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
any
demosthenes
who
can
convince
me
that
i
have
a
red
moustache
when
i
know
that
it
is
black
as
i
listen
to
an
orator
i
may
perhaps
grow
sentimental
and
weep
but
my
fundamental
conviction
based
for
the
most
part
on
unmistakable
evidence
and
fact
is
not
changed
in
the
least
my
lawyer
maintained
that
i
was
young
and
foolish
and
that
i
was
talking
childish
nonsense
in
his
opinion
for
one
thing
an
obvious
fact
becomes
still
more
obvious
through
light
being
thrown
upon
it
by
conscientious
well
informed
people
for
another
talent
is
an
elemental
force
a
hurricane
capable
of
turning
even
stones
to
dust
let
alone
such
trifles
as
the
convictions
of
artisans
and
merchants
of
the
second
guild
it
is
as
hard
for
human
weakness
to
struggle
against
talent
as
to
look
at
the
sun
without
winking
or
to
stop
the
wind
one
simple
mortal
by
the
power
of
the
word
turns
thousands
of
convinced
savages
to
christianity
odysseus
was
a
man
of
the
firmest
convictions
but
he
succumbed
to
the
syrens
and
so
on
all
history
consists
of
similar
examples
and
in
life
they
are
met
with
at
every
turn
and
so
it
is
bound
to
be
or
the
intelligent
and
talented
man
would
have
no
superiority
over
the
stupid
and
incompetent
i
stuck
to
my
point
and
went
on
maintaining
that
convictions
are
stronger
than
any
talent
though
frankly
speaking
i
could
not
have
defined
exactly
what
i
meant
by
conviction
or
what
i
meant
by
talent
most
likely
i
simply
talked
for
the
sake
of
talking
take
you
for
example
said
the
lawyer
you
are
convinced
at
this
moment
that
your
fianc
e
is
an
angel
and
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
whole
town
happier
than
you
but
i
tell
you
ten
or
twenty
minutes
would
be
enough
for
me
to
make
you
sit
down
to
this
table
and
write
to
your
fianc
e
breaking
off
your
engagement
i
laughed
don
t
laugh
i
am
speaking
seriously
said
my
friend
if
i
choose
in
twenty
minutes
you
will
be
happy
at
the
thought
that
you
need
not
get
married
goodness
knows
what
talent
i
have
but
you
are
not
one
of
the
strong
sort
well
try
it
on
said
i
no
what
for
i
am
only
telling
you
this
you
are
a
good
boy
and
it
would
be
cruel
to
subject
you
to
such
an
experiment
and
besides
i
am
not
in
good
form
to
day
we
sat
down
to
supper
the
wine
and
the
thought
of
natasha
my
beloved
flooded
my
whole
being
with
youth
and
happiness
my
happiness
was
so
boundless
that
the
lawyer
sitting
opposite
to
me
with
his
green
eyes
seemed
to
me
an
unhappy
man
so
small
so
grey
do
try
i
persisted
come
i
entreat
you
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
and
frowned
evidently
i
was
beginning
to
bore
him
i
know
he
said
after
my
experiment
you
will
say
thank
you
and
will
call
me
your
saviour
but
you
see
i
must
think
of
your
fianc
e
too
she
loves
you
your
jilting
her
would
make
her
suffer
and
what
a
charming
creature
she
is
i
envy
you
the
lawyer
sighed
sipped
his
wine
and
began
talking
of
how
charming
my
natasha
was
he
had
an
extraordinary
gift
of
description
he
could
knock
you
off
a
regular
string
of
words
about
a
woman
s
eyelashes
or
her
little
finger
i
listened
to
him
with
relish
i
have
seen
a
great
many
women
in
my
day
he
said
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
speak
as
a
friend
your
natasha
andreyevna
is
a
pearl
a
rare
girl
of
course
she
has
her
defects
many
of
them
in
fact
if
you
like
but
still
she
is
fascinating
and
the
lawyer
began
talking
of
my
fianc
e
s
defects
now
i
understand
very
well
that
he
was
talking
of
women
in
general
of
their
weak
points
in
general
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
talking
only
of
natasha
he
went
into
ecstasies
over
her
turn
up
nose
her
shrieks
her
shrill
laugh
her
airs
and
graces
precisely
all
the
things
i
so
disliked
in
her
all
that
was
to
his
thinking
infinitely
sweet
graceful
and
feminine
without
my
noticing
it
he
quickly
passed
from
his
enthusiastic
tone
to
one
of
fatherly
admonition
and
then
to
a
light
and
derisive
one
there
was
no
presiding
judge
and
no
one
to
check
the
diffusiveness
of
the
lawyer
i
had
not
time
to
open
my
mouth
besides
what
could
i
say
what
my
friend
said
was
not
new
it
was
what
everyone
has
known
for
ages
and
the
whole
venom
lay
not
in
what
he
said
but
in
the
damnable
form
he
put
it
in
it
really
was
beyond
anything
as
i
listened
to
him
then
i
learned
that
the
same
word
has
thousands
of
shades
of
meaning
according
to
the
tone
in
which
it
is
pronounced
and
the
form
which
is
given
to
the
sentence
of
course
i
can
not
reproduce
the
tone
or
the
form
i
can
only
say
that
as
i
listened
to
my
friend
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
i
was
moved
to
resentment
indignation
and
contempt
together
with
him
i
even
believed
him
when
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
informed
me
that
i
was
a
great
man
that
i
was
worthy
of
a
better
fate
that
i
was
destined
to
achieve
something
in
the
future
which
marriage
would
hinder
my
friend
he
exclaimed
pressing
my
hand
i
beseech
you
i
adjure
you
stop
before
it
is
too
late
stop
may
heaven
preserve
you
from
this
strange
cruel
mistake
my
friend
do
not
ruin
your
youth
believe
me
or
not
as
you
choose
but
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
i
sat
down
to
the
table
and
wrote
to
my
fianc
e
breaking
off
the
engagement
as
i
wrote
i
felt
relieved
that
it
was
not
yet
too
late
to
rectify
my
mistake
sealing
the
letter
i
hastened
out
into
the
street
to
post
it
the
lawyer
himself
came
with
me
excellent
capital
he
applauded
me
as
my
letter
to
natasha
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
box
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
i
am
glad
for
you
after
walking
a
dozen
paces
with
me
the
lawyer
went
on
of
course
marriage
has
its
good
points
i
for
instance
belong
to
the
class
of
people
to
whom
marriage
and
home
life
is
everything
and
he
proceeded
to
describe
his
life
and
lay
before
me
all
the
hideousness
of
a
solitary
bachelor
existence
he
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
his
future
wife
of
the
sweets
of
ordinary
family
life
and
was
so
eloquent
so
sincere
in
his
ecstasies
that
by
the
time
we
had
reached
his
door
i
was
in
despair
what
are
you
doing
to
me
you
horrible
man
i
said
gasping
you
have
ruined
me
why
did
you
make
me
write
that
cursed
letter
i
love
her
i
love
her
and
i
protested
my
love
i
was
horrified
at
my
conduct
which
now
seemed
to
me
wild
and
senseless
it
is
impossible
gentlemen
to
imagine
a
more
violent
emotion
than
i
experienced
at
that
moment
oh
what
i
went
through
what
i
suffered
if
some
kind
person
had
thrust
a
revolver
into
my
hand
at
that
moment
i
should
have
put
a
bullet
through
my
brains
with
pleasure
come
come
said
the
lawyer
slapping
me
on
the
shoulder
and
he
laughed
give
over
crying
the
letter
won
t
reach
your
fianc
e
it
was
not
you
who
wrote
the
address
but
i
and
i
muddled
it
so
they
won
t
be
able
to
make
it
out
at
the
post
office
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
not
to
argue
about
what
you
don
t
understand
now
gentlemen
i
leave
it
to
the
next
to
speak
the
fifth
juryman
settled
himself
more
comfortably
and
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
begin
his
story
when
we
heard
the
clock
strike
on
spassky
tower
twelve
one
of
the
jurymen
counted
and
into
which
class
gentlemen
would
you
put
the
emotions
that
are
being
experienced
now
by
the
man
we
are
trying
he
that
murderer
is
spending
the
night
in
a
convict
cell
here
in
the
court
sitting
or
lying
down
and
of
course
not
sleeping
and
throughout
the
whole
sleepless
night
listening
to
that
chime
what
is
he
thinking
of
what
visions
are
haunting
him
and
the
jurymen
all
suddenly
forgot
about
strong
impressions
what
their
companion
who
had
once
written
a
letter
to
his
natasha
had
suffered
seemed
unimportant
even
not
amusing
and
no
one
said
anything
more
they
began
quietly
and
in
silence
lying
down
to
sleep
drunk
a
manufacturer
called
frolov
a
handsome
dark
man
with
a
round
beard
and
a
soft
velvety
expression
in
his
eyes
and
almer
his
lawyer
an
elderly
man
with
a
big
rough
head
were
drinking
in
one
of
the
public
rooms
of
a
restaurant
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
they
had
both
come
to
the
restaurant
straight
from
a
ball
and
so
were
wearing
dress
coats
and
white
ties
except
them
and
the
waiters
at
the
door
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
room
by
frolov
s
orders
no
one
else
was
admitted
they
began
by
drinking
a
big
wine
glass
of
vodka
and
eating
oysters
good
said
almer
it
was
i
brought
oysters
into
fashion
for
the
first
course
my
boy
the
vodka
burns
and
stings
your
throat
and
you
have
a
voluptuous
sensation
in
your
throat
when
you
swallow
an
oyster
don
t
you
a
dignified
waiter
with
a
shaven
upper
lip
and
grey
whiskers
put
a
sauceboat
on
the
table
what
s
that
you
are
serving
asked
frolov
sauce
proven
ale
for
the
herring
sir
what
is
that
the
way
to
serve
it
shouted
frolov
not
looking
into
the
sauceboat
do
you
call
that
sauce
you
don
t
know
how
to
wait
you
blockhead
frolov
s
velvety
eyes
flashed
he
twisted
a
corner
of
the
table
cloth
round
his
finger
made
a
slight
movement
and
the
dishes
the
candlesticks
and
the
bottles
all
jingling
and
clattering
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
the
waiters
long
accustomed
to
pot
house
catastrophes
ran
up
to
the
table
and
began
picking
up
the
fragments
with
grave
and
unconcerned
faces
like
surgeons
at
an
operation
how
well
you
know
how
to
manage
them
said
almer
and
he
laughed
but
move
a
little
away
from
the
table
or
you
will
step
in
the
caviare
call
the
engineer
here
cried
frolov
this
was
the
name
given
to
a
decrepit
doleful
old
man
who
really
had
once
been
an
engineer
and
very
well
off
he
had
squandered
all
his
property
and
towards
the
end
of
his
life
had
got
into
a
restaurant
where
he
looked
after
the
waiters
and
singers
and
carried
out
various
commissions
relating
to
the
fair
sex
appearing
at
the
summons
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
respectfully
listen
my
good
man
frolov
said
addressing
him
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
disorder
how
queerly
you
fellows
wait
don
t
you
know
that
i
don
t
like
it
devil
take
you
i
shall
give
up
coming
to
you
i
beg
you
graciously
to
excuse
it
alexey
semyonitch
said
the
engineer
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
i
will
take
steps
immediately
and
your
slightest
wishes
shall
be
carried
out
in
the
best
and
speediest
way
well
that
ll
do
you
can
go
the
engineer
bowed
staggered
back
still
doubled
up
and
disappeared
through
the
doorway
with
a
final
flash
of
the
false
diamonds
on
his
shirt
front
and
fingers
the
table
was
laid
again
almer
drank
red
wine
and
ate
with
relish
some
sort
of
bird
served
with
truffles
and
ordered
a
matelote
of
eelpouts
and
a
sterlet
with
its
tail
in
its
mouth
frolov
only
drank
vodka
and
ate
nothing
but
bread
he
rubbed
his
face
with
his
open
hands
scowled
and
was
evidently
out
of
humour
both
were
silent
there
was
a
stillness
two
electric
lights
in
opaque
shades
flickered
and
hissed
as
though
they
were
angry
the
gypsy
girls
passed
the
door
softly
humming
one
drinks
and
is
none
the
merrier
said
frolov
the
more
i
pour
into
myself
the
more
sober
i
become
other
people
grow
festive
with
vodka
but
i
suffer
from
anger
disgusting
thoughts
sleeplessness
why
is
it
old
man
that
people
don
t
invent
some
other
pleasure
besides
drunkenness
and
debauchery
it
s
really
horrible
you
had
better
send
for
the
gypsy
girls
confound
them
the
head
of
an
old
gypsy
woman
appeared
in
the
door
from
the
passage
alexey
semyonitch
the
gypsies
are
asking
for
tea
and
brandy
said
the
old
woman
may
we
order
it
yes
answered
frolov
you
know
they
get
a
percentage
from
the
restaurant
keeper
for
asking
the
visitors
to
treat
them
nowadays
you
can
t
even
believe
a
man
when
he
asks
for
vodka
the
people
are
all
mean
vile
spoilt
take
these
waiters
for
instance
they
have
countenances
like
professors
and
grey
heads
they
get
two
hundred
roubles
a
month
they
live
in
houses
of
their
own
and
send
their
girls
to
the
high
school
but
you
may
swear
at
them
and
give
yourself
airs
as
much
as
you
please
for
a
rouble
the
engineer
will
gulp
down
a
whole
pot
of
mustard
and
crow
like
a
cock
on
my
honour
if
one
of
them
would
take
offence
i
would
make
him
a
present
of
a
thousand
roubles
what
s
the
matter
with
you
said
almer
looking
at
him
with
surprise
whence
this
melancholy
you
are
red
in
the
face
you
look
like
a
wild
animal
what
s
the
matter
with
you
it
s
horrid
there
s
one
thing
i
can
t
get
out
of
my
head
it
seems
as
though
it
is
nailed
there
and
it
won
t
come
out
a
round
little
old
man
buried
in
fat
and
completely
bald
wearing
a
short
reefer
jacket
and
lilac
waistcoat
and
carrying
a
guitar
walked
into
the
room
he
made
an
idiotic
face
drew
himself
up
and
saluted
like
a
soldier
ah
the
parasite
said
frolov
let
me
introduce
him
he
has
made
his
fortune
by
grunting
like
a
pig
come
here
he
poured
vodka
wine
and
brandy
into
a
glass
sprinkled
pepper
and
salt
into
it
mixed
it
all
up
and
gave
it
to
the
parasite
the
latter
tossed
it
off
and
smacked
his
lips
with
gusto
he
s
accustomed
to
drink
a
mess
so
that
pure
wine
makes
him
sick
said
frolov
come
parasite
sit
down
and
sing
the
old
man
sat
down
touched
the
strings
with
his
fat
fingers
and
began
singing
neetka
neetka
margareetka
after
drinking
champagne
frolov
was
drunk
he
thumped
with
his
fist
on
the
table
and
said
yes
there
s
something
that
sticks
in
my
head
it
won
t
give
me
a
minute
s
peace
why
what
is
it
i
can
t
tell
you
it
s
a
secret
it
s
something
so
private
that
i
could
only
speak
of
it
in
my
prayers
but
if
you
like
as
a
sign
of
friendship
between
ourselves
only
mind
to
no
one
no
no
no
i
ll
tell
you
it
will
ease
my
heart
but
for
god
s
sake
listen
and
forget
it
frolov
bent
down
to
almer
and
for
a
minute
breathed
in
his
ear
i
hate
my
wife
he
brought
out
the
lawyer
looked
at
him
with
surprise
yes
yes
my
wife
marya
mihalovna
frolov
muttered
flushing
red
i
hate
her
and
that
s
all
about
it
what
for
i
don
t
know
myself
i
ve
only
been
married
two
years
i
married
as
you
know
for
love
and
now
i
hate
her
like
a
mortal
enemy
like
this
parasite
here
saving
your
presence
and
there
is
no
cause
no
sort
of
cause
when
she
sits
by
me
eats
or
says
anything
my
whole
soul
boils
i
can
scarcely
restrain
myself
from
being
rude
to
her
it
s
something
one
can
t
describe
to
leave
her
or
tell
her
the
truth
is
utterly
impossible
because
it
would
be
a
scandal
and
living
with
her
is
worse
than
hell
for
me
i
can
t
stay
at
home
i
spend
my
days
at
business
and
in
the
restaurants
and
spend
my
nights
in
dissipation
come
how
is
one
to
explain
this
hatred
she
is
not
an
ordinary
woman
but
handsome
clever
quiet
the
old
man
stamped
his
foot
and
began
singing
i
went
a
walk
with
a
captain
bold
and
in
his
ear
my
secrets
told
i
must
own
i
always
thought
that
marya
mihalovna
was
not
at
all
the
right
person
for
you
said
almer
after
a
brief
silence
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
do
you
mean
she
is
too
well
educated
i
took
the
gold
medal
at
the
commercial
school
myself
i
have
been
to
paris
three
times
i
am
not
cleverer
than
you
of
course
but
i
am
no
more
foolish
than
my
wife
no
brother
education
is
not
the
sore
point
let
me
tell
you
how
all
the
trouble
began
it
began
with
my
suddenly
fancying
that
she
had
married
me
not
from
love
but
for
the
sake
of
my
money
this
idea
took
possession
of
my
brain
i
have
done
all
i
could
think
of
but
the
cursed
thing
sticks
and
to
make
it
worse
my
wife
was
overtaken
with
a
passion
for
luxury
getting
into
a
sack
of
gold
after
poverty
she
took
to
flinging
it
in
all
directions
she
went
quite
off
her
head
and
was
so
carried
away
that
she
used
to
get
through
twenty
thousand
every
month
and
i
am
a
distrustful
man
i
don
t
believe
in
anyone
i
suspect
everybody
and
the
more
friendly
you
are
to
me
the
greater
my
torment
i
keep
fancying
i
am
being
flattered
for
my
money
i
trust
no
one
i
am
a
difficult
man
my
boy
very
difficult
frolov
emptied
his
glass
at
one
gulp
and
went
on
but
that
s
all
nonsense
he
said
one
never
ought
to
speak
of
it
it
s
stupid
i
am
tipsy
and
i
have
been
chattering
and
now
you
are
looking
at
me
with
lawyer
s
eyes
glad
you
know
some
one
else
s
secret
well
well
let
us
drop
this
conversation
let
us
drink
i
say
he
said
addressing
a
waiter
is
mustafa
here
fetch
him
in
shortly
afterwards
there
walked
into
the
room
a
little
tatar
boy
aged
about
twelve
wearing
a
dress
coat
and
white
gloves
come
here
frolov
said
to
him
explain
to
us
the
following
fact
there
was
a
time
when
you
tatars
conquered
us
and
took
tribute
from
us
but
now
you
serve
us
as
waiters
and
sell
dressing
gowns
how
do
you
explain
such
a
change
mustafa
raised
his
eyebrows
and
said
in
a
shrill
voice
with
a
sing
song
intonation
the
mutability
of
destiny
almer
looked
at
his
grave
face
and
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
well
give
him
a
rouble
said
frolov
he
is
making
his
fortune
out
of
the
mutability
of
destiny
he
is
only
kept
here
for
the
sake
of
those
two
words
drink
mustafa
you
will
make
a
gre
eat
rascal
i
mean
it
is
awful
how
many
of
your
sort
are
toadies
hanging
about
rich
men
the
number
of
these
peaceful
bandits
and
robbers
is
beyond
all
reckoning
shouldn
t
we
send
for
the
gypsies
now
eh
fetch
the
gypsies
along
the
gypsies
who
had
been
hanging
about
wearily
in
the
corridors
for
a
long
time
burst
with
whoops
into
the
room
and
a
wild
orgy
began
drink
frolov
shouted
to
them
drink
seed
of
pharaoh
sing
a
a
ah
in
the
winter
time
o
o
ho
the
sledge
was
flying
the
gypsies
sang
whistled
danced
in
the
frenzy
which
sometimes
takes
possession
of
spoilt
and
very
wealthy
men
broad
natures
frolov
began
to
play
the
fool
he
ordered
supper
and
champagne
for
the
gypsies
broke
the
shade
of
the
electric
light
shied
bottles
at
the
pictures
and
looking
glasses
and
did
it
all
apparently
without
the
slightest
enjoyment
scowling
and
shouting
irritably
with
contempt
for
the
people
with
an
expression
of
hatred
in
his
eyes
and
his
manners
he
made
the
engineer
sing
a
solo
made
the
bass
singers
drink
a
mixture
of
wine
vodka
and
oil
at
six
o
clock
they
handed
him
the
bill
nine
hundred
and
twenty
five
roubles
forty
kopecks
said
almer
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
s
it
for
no
wait
we
must
go
into
it
stop
muttered
frolov
pulling
out
his
pocket
book
well
let
them
rob
me
that
s
what
i
m
rich
for
to
be
robbed

parasites

lawyer

six
thousand
a
year

of
me
and

for
but
excuse
me
i
don
t
know
what
i
am
saying
as
he
was
returning
home
with
almer
frolov
murmured
going
home
is
awful
to
me
yes
there
isn
t
a
human
being
i
can
open
my
soul
to
they
are
all
robbers
traitors
oh
why
did
i
tell
you
my
secret
yes
why

me
why
at
the
entrance
to
his
house
he
craned
forward
towards
almer
and
staggering
kissed
him
on
the
lips
having
the
old
moscow
habit
of
kissing
indiscriminately
on
every
occasion
good
bye
i
am
a
difficult
hateful
man
he
said
a
horrid
drunken
shameless
life

are
a
well
educated
clever
man
but
you
only
laugh
and
drink
with
me
there

no
help
from
any
of
you
but
if
you
were
a
friend
to
me
if
you
were
an
honest
man
in
reality
you
ought
to
have
said
to
me
ugh
you
vile
hateful
man
you
reptile

doctor

smelling
of
iodoform
all
the
landowners
great
and
small
and
so
on
there
are
about
fifty
people
assembled
in
all
precisely
at
twelve
o
clock
the
visitors
with
long
faces
make
their
way
from
all
the
rooms
to
the
big
hall
there
are
carpets
on
the
floor
and
their
steps
are
noiseless
but
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
makes
them
instinctively
walk
on
tip
toe
holding
out
their
hands
to
balance
themselves
in
the
hall
everything
is
already
prepared
father
yevmeny
a
little
old
man
in
a
high
faded
cap
puts
on
his
black
vestments
konkordiev
the
deacon
already
in
his
vestments
and
as
red
as
a
crab
is
noiselessly
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
missal
and
putting
slips
of
paper
in
it
at
the
door
leading
to
the
vestibule
luka
the
sacristan
puffing
out
his
cheeks
and
making
round
eyes
blows
up
the
censer
the
hall
is
gradually
filled
with
bluish
transparent
smoke
and
the
smell
of
incense
gelikonsky
the
elementary
schoolmaster
a
young
man
with
big
pimples
on
his
frightened
face
wearing
a
new
greatcoat
like
a
sack
carries
round
wax
candles
on
a
silver
plated
tray
the
hostess
lyubov
petrovna
stands
in
the
front
by
a
little
table
with
a
dish
of
funeral
rice
on
it
and
holds
her
handkerchief
in
readiness
to
her
face
there
is
a
profound
stillness
broken
from
time
to
time
by
sighs
everybody
has
a
long
solemn
face
the
requiem
service
begins
the
blue
smoke
curls
up
from
the
censer
and
plays
in
the
slanting
sunbeams
the
lighted
candles
faintly
splutter
the
singing
at
first
harsh
and
deafening
soon
becomes
quiet
and
musical
as
the
choir
gradually
adapt
themselves
to
the
acoustic
conditions
of
the
rooms
the
tunes
are
all
mournful
and
sad
the
guests
are
gradually
brought
to
a
melancholy
mood
and
grow
pensive
thoughts
of
the
brevity
of
human
life
of
mutability
of
worldly
vanity
stray
through
their
brains
they
recall
the
deceased
zavzyatov
a
thick
set
red
cheeked
man
who
used
to
drink
off
a
bottle
of
champagne
at
one
gulp
and
smash
looking
glasses
with
his
forehead
and
when
they
sing
with
thy
saints
o
lord
and
the
sobs
of
their
hostess
are
audible
the
guests
shift
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
the
more
emotional
begin
to
feel
a
tickling
in
their
throat
and
about
their
eyelids
marfutkin
the
president
of
the
zemstvo
to
stifle
the
unpleasant
feeling
bends
down
to
the
police
captain
s
ear
and
whispers
i
was
at
ivan
fyodoritch
s
yesterday
pyotr
petrovitch
and
i
took
all
the
tricks
playing
no
trumps
yes
indeed
olga
andreyevna
was
so
exasperated
that
her
false
tooth
fell
out
of
her
mouth
but
at
last
the
eternal
memory
is
sung
gelikonsky
respectfully
takes
away
the
candles
and
the
memorial
service
is
over
thereupon
there
follows
a
momentary
commotion
there
is
a
changing
of
vestments
and
a
thanksgiving
service
after
the
thanksgiving
while
father
yevmeny
is
disrobing
the
visitors
rub
their
hands
and
cough
while
their
hostess
tells
some
anecdote
of
the
good
heartedness
of
the
deceased
trifon
lvovitch
pray
come
to
lunch
friends
she
says
concluding
her
story
with
a
sigh
the
visitors
trying
not
to
push
or
tread
on
each
other
s
feet
hasten
into
the
dining
room
there
the
luncheon
is
awaiting
them
the
repast
is
so
magnificent
that
the
deacon
konkordiev
thinks
it
his
duty
every
year
to
fling
up
his
hands
as
he
looks
at
it
and
shaking
his
head
in
amazement
say
supernatural
it
s
not
so
much
like
human
fare
father
yevmeny
as
offerings
to
the
gods
the
lunch
is
certainly
exceptional
everything
that
the
flora
and
fauna
of
the
country
can
furnish
is
on
the
table
but
the
only
thing
supernatural
about
it
perhaps
is
that
on
the
table
there
is
everything
except
alcoholic
beverages
lyubov
petrovna
has
taken
a
vow
never
to
have
in
her
house
cards
or
spirituous
liquors
the
two
sources
of
her
husband
s
ruin
and
the
only
bottles
contain
oil
and
vinegar
as
though
in
mockery
and
chastisement
of
the
guests
who
are
to
a
man
desperately
fond
of
the
bottle
and
given
to
tippling
please
help
yourselves
gentlemen
the
marshal
s
widow
presses
them
only
you
must
excuse
me
i
have
no
vodka
i
have
none
in
the
house
the
guests
approach
the
table
and
hesitatingly
attack
the
pie
but
the
progress
with
eating
is
slow
in
the
plying
of
forks
in
the
cutting
up
and
munching
there
is
a
certain
sloth
and
apathy
evidently
something
is
wanting
i
feel
as
though
i
had
lost
something
one
of
the
justices
of
the
peace
whispers
to
the
other
i
feel
as
i
did
when
my
wife
ran
away
with
the
engineer
i
can
t
eat
marfutkin
before
beginning
to
eat
fumbles
for
a
long
time
in
his
pocket
and
looks
for
his
handkerchief
oh
my
handkerchief
must
be
in
my
greatcoat
he
recalls
in
a
loud
voice
and
here
i
am
looking
for
it
and
he
goes
into
the
vestibule
where
the
fur
coats
are
hanging
up
he
returns
from
the
vestibule
with
glistening
eyes
and
at
once
attacks
the
pie
with
relish
i
say
it
s
horrid
munching
away
with
a
dry
mouth
isn
t
it
he
whispers
to
father
yevmeny
go
into
the
vestibule
father
there
s
a
bottle
there
in
my
fur
coat
only
mind
you
are
careful
don
t
make
a
clatter
with
the
bottle
father
yevmeny
recollects
that
he
has
some
direction
to
give
to
luka
and
trips
off
to
the
vestibule
father
a
couple
of
words
in
confidence
says
dvornyagin
overtaking
him
you
should
see
the
fur
coat
i
ve
bought
myself
gentlemen
hrumov
boasts
it
s
worth
a
thousand
and
i
gave
you
won
t
believe
it
two
hundred
and
fifty
not
a
farthing
more
at
any
other
time
the
guests
would
have
greeted
this
information
with
indifference
but
now
they
display
surprise
and
incredulity
in
the
end
they
all
troop
out
into
the
vestibule
to
look
at
the
fur
coat
and
go
on
looking
at
it
till
the
doctor
s
man
mikeshka
carries
five
empty
bottles
out
on
the
sly
when
the
steamed
sturgeon
is
served
marfutkin
remembers
that
he
has
left
his
cigar
case
in
his
sledge
and
goes
to
the
stable
that
he
may
not
be
lonely
on
this
expedition
he
takes
with
him
the
deacon
who
appropriately
feels
it
necessary
to
have
a
look
at
his
horse
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
lyubov
petrovna
is
sitting
in
her
study
writing
a
letter
to
an
old
friend
in
petersburg
to
day
as
in
past
years
she
writes
among
other
things
i
had
a
memorial
service
for
my
dear
husband
all
my
neighbours
came
to
the
service
they
are
a
simple
rough
set
but
what
hearts
i
gave
them
a
splendid
lunch
but
of
course
as
in
previous
years
without
a
drop
of
alcoholic
liquor
ever
since
he
died
from
excessive
drinking
i
have
vowed
to
establish
temperance
in
this
district
and
thereby
to
expiate
his
sins
i
have
begun
the
campaign
for
temperance
at
my
own
house
father
yevmeny
is
delighted
with
my
efforts
and
helps
me
both
in
word
and
deed
oh
ma
ch
re
if
you
knew
how
fond
my
bears
are
of
me
the
president
of
the
zemstvo
marfutkin
kissed
my
hand
after
lunch
held
it
a
long
while
to
his
lips
and
wagging
his
head
in
an
absurd
way
burst
into
tears
so
much
feeling
but
no
words
father
yevmeny
that
delightful
little
old
man
sat
down
by
me
and
looking
tearfully
at
me
kept
babbling
something
like
a
child
i
did
not
understand
what
he
said
but
i
know
how
to
understand
true
feeling
the
police
captain
the
handsome
man
of
whom
i
wrote
to
you
went
down
on
his
knees
to
me
tried
to
read
me
some
verses
of
his
own
composition
he
is
a
poet
but
his
feelings
were
too
much
for
him
he
lurched
and
fell
over
that
huge
giant
went
into
hysterics
you
can
imagine
my
delight
the
day
did
not
pass
without
a
hitch
however
poor
alalykin
the
president
of
the
judges
assembly
a
stout
and
apoplectic
man
was
overcome
by
illness
and
lay
on
the
sofa
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
for
two
hours
we
had
to
pour
water
on
him
i
am
thankful
to
doctor
dvornyagin
he
had
brought
a
bottle
of
brandy
from
his
dispensary
and
he
moistened
the
patient
s
temples
which
quickly
revived
him
and
he
was
able
to
be
moved
a
bad
business
who
goes
there
no
answer
the
watchman
sees
nothing
but
through
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
the
trees
distinctly
hears
someone
walking
along
the
avenue
ahead
of
him
a
march
night
cloudy
and
foggy
envelopes
the
earth
and
it
seems
to
the
watchman
that
the
earth
the
sky
and
he
himself
with
his
thoughts
are
all
merged
together
into
something
vast
and
impenetrably
black
he
can
only
grope
his
way
who
goes
there
the
watchman
repeats
and
he
begins
to
fancy
that
he
hears
whispering
and
smothered
laughter
who
s
there
it
s
i
friend
answers
an
old
man
s
voice
but
who
are
you
i
a
traveller
what
sort
of
traveller
the
watchman
cries
angrily
trying
to
disguise
his
terror
by
shouting
what
the
devil
do
you
want
here
you
go
prowling
about
the
graveyard
at
night
you
ruffian
you
don
t
say
it
s
a
graveyard
here
why
what
else
of
course
it
s
the
graveyard
don
t
you
see
it
is
o
o
oh
queen
of
heaven
there
is
a
sound
of
an
old
man
sighing
i
see
nothing
my
good
soul
nothing
oh
the
darkness
the
darkness
you
can
t
see
your
hand
before
your
face
it
is
dark
friend
o
o
oh
but
who
are
you
i
am
a
pilgrim
friend
a
wandering
man
the
devils
the
nightbirds
nice
sort
of
pilgrims
they
are
drunkards
mutters
the
watchman
reassured
by
the
tone
and
sighs
of
the
stranger
one
s
tempted
to
sin
by
you
they
drink
the
day
away
and
prowl
about
at
night
but
i
fancy
i
heard
you
were
not
alone
it
sounded
like
two
or
three
of
you
i
am
alone
friend
alone
quite
alone
o
o
oh
our
sins
the
watchman
stumbles
up
against
the
man
and
stops
how
did
you
get
here
he
asks
i
have
lost
my
way
good
man
i
was
walking
to
the
mitrievsky
mill
and
i
lost
my
way
whew
is
this
the
road
to
mitrievsky
mill
you
sheepshead
for
the
mitrievsky
mill
you
must
keep
much
more
to
the
left
straight
out
of
the
town
along
the
high
road
you
have
been
drinking
and
have
gone
a
couple
of
miles
out
of
your
way
you
must
have
had
a
drop
in
the
town
i
did
friend
truly
i
did
i
won
t
hide
my
sins
but
how
am
i
to
go
now
go
straight
on
and
on
along
this
avenue
till
you
can
go
no
farther
and
then
turn
at
once
to
the
left
and
go
till
you
have
crossed
the
whole
graveyard
right
to
the
gate
there
will
be
a
gate
there
open
it
and
go
with
god
s
blessing
mind
you
don
t
fall
into
the
ditch
and
when
you
are
out
of
the
graveyard
you
go
all
the
way
by
the
fields
till
you
come
out
on
the
main
road
god
give
you
health
friend
may
the
queen
of
heaven
save
you
and
have
mercy
on
you
you
might
take
me
along
good
man

me
to
the
gate
as
though
i
had
the
time
to
waste

by
yourself

pray
for
you

hand
before

s
face

s
so
dark
so
dark
show
me
the
way
sir
as
though
i
had
the
time
to
take
you
about
if
i
were
to
play
the
nurse
to
everyone
i
should
never
have
done
for
christ
s
sake
take
me
i
can
t
see
and
i
am
afraid
to
go
alone
through
the
graveyard
it
s
terrifying
friend
it
s
terrifying
i
am
afraid
good
man
there
s
no
getting
rid
of
you
sighs
the
watchman
all
right
then
come
along
the
watchman
and
the
traveller
go
on
together
they
walk
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
silence
a
damp
cutting
wind
blows
straight
into
their
faces
and
the
unseen
trees
murmuring
and
rustling
scatter
big
drops
upon
them
the
path
is
almost
entirely
covered
with
puddles
there
is
one
thing
passes
my
understanding
says
the
watchman
after
a
prolonged
silence
how
you
got
here
the
gate
s
locked
did
you
climb
over
the
wall
if
you
did
climb
over
the
wall
that
s
the
last
thing
you
would
expect
of
an
old
man
i
don
t
know
friend
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
say
myself
how
i
got
here
it
s
a
visitation
a
chastisement
of
the
lord
truly
a
visitation
the
evil
one
confounded
me
so
you
are
a
watchman
here
friend
yes
the
only
one
for
the
whole
graveyard
there
is
such
a
violent
gust
of
wind
that
both
stop
for
a
minute
waiting
till
the
violence
of
the
wind
abates
the
watchman
answers
there
are
three
of
us
but
one
is
lying
ill
in
a
fever
and
the
other
s
asleep
he
and
i
take
turns
about
ah
to
be
sure
friend
what
a
wind
the
dead
must
hear
it
it
howls
like
a
wild
beast
o
o
oh
and
where
do
you
come
from
from
a
distance
friend
i
am
from
vologda
a
long
way
off
i
go
from
one
holy
place
to
another
and
pray
for
people
save
me
and
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
the
watchman
stops
for
a
minute
to
light
his
pipe
he
stoops
down
behind
the
traveller
s
back
and
lights
several
matches
the
gleam
of
the
first
match
lights
up
for
one
instant
a
bit
of
the
avenue
on
the
right
a
white
tombstone
with
an
angel
and
a
dark
cross
the
light
of
the
second
match
flaring
up
brightly
and
extinguished
by
the
wind
flashes
like
lightning
on
the
left
side
and
from
the
darkness
nothing
stands
out
but
the
angle
of
some
sort
of
trellis
the
third
match
throws
light
to
right
and
to
left
revealing
the
white
tombstone
the
dark
cross
and
the
trellis
round
a
child
s
grave
the
departed
sleep
the
dear
ones
sleep
the
stranger
mutters
sighing
loudly
they
all
sleep
alike
rich
and
poor
wise
and
foolish
good
and
wicked
they
are
of
the
same
value
now
and
they
will
sleep
till
the
last
trump
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
peace
eternal
be
theirs
here
we
are
walking
along
now
but
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
be
lying
here
ourselves
says
the
watchman
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
we
shall
all
there
is
no
man
who
will
not
die
o
o
oh
our
doings
are
wicked
our
thoughts
are
deceitful
sins
sins
my
soul
accursed
ever
covetous
my
belly
greedy
and
lustful
i
have
angered
the
lord
and
there
is
no
salvation
for
me
in
this
world
and
the
next
i
am
deep
in
sins
like
a
worm
in
the
earth
yes
and
you
have
to
die
you
are
right
there
death
is
easier
for
a
pilgrim
than
for
fellows
like
us
says
the
watchman
there
are
pilgrims
of
different
sorts
there
are
the
real
ones
who
are
god
fearing
men
and
watch
over
their
own
souls
and
there
are
such
as
stray
about
the
graveyard
at
night
and
are
a
delight
to
the
devils
ye
es
there
s
one
who
is
a
pilgrim
could
give
you
a
crack
on
the
pate
with
an
axe
if
he
liked
and
knock
the
breath
out
of
you
what
are
you
talking
like
that
for
oh
nothing
why
i
fancy
here
s
the
gate
yes
it
is
open
it
good
man
the
watchman
feeling
his
way
opens
the
gate
leads
the
pilgrim
out
by
the
sleeve
and
says
here
s
the
end
of
the
graveyard
now
you
must
keep
on
through
the
open
fields
till
you
get
to
the
main
road
only
close
here
there
will
be
the
boundary
ditch
don
t
fall
in
and
when
you
come
out
on
to
the
road
turn
to
the
right
and
keep
on
till
you
reach
the
mill
o
o
oh
sighs
the
pilgrim
after
a
pause
and
now
i
am
thinking
that
i
have
no
cause
to
go
to
mitrievsky
mill

the
devil

i
go
there

had
better
stay

the
stranger
with
a
hoarse
chuckle

himself

carnival
week
well
i
am
gubaryev
himself
tell
us
something
else
the
watchman
does
not
believe
him
but
he
feels
all
over
such
a
cold
oppressive
terror
that
he
starts
off
and
begins
hurriedly
feeling
for
the
gate
stop
where
are
you
off
to
says
the
stranger
clutching
him
by
the
arm
aie
aie
aie
what
a
fellow
you
are
how
can
you
leave
me
all
alone
let
go
cries
the
watchman
trying
to
pull
his
arm
away
sto
op
i
bid
you
stop
and
you
stop
don
t
struggle
you
dirty
dog
if
you
want
to
stay
among
the
living
stop
and
hold
your
tongue
till
i
tell
you
it
s
only
that
i
don
t
care
to
spill
blood
or
you
would
have
been
a
dead
man
long
ago
you
scurvy
rascal
stop
the
watchman
s
knees
give
way
under
him
in
his
terror
he
shuts
his
eyes
and
trembling
all
over
huddles
close
to
the
wall
he
would
like
to
call
out
but
he
knows
his
cries
would
not
reach
any
living
thing
the
stranger
stands
beside
him
and
holds
him
by
the
arm
three
minutes
pass
in
silence
one
s
in
a
fever
another
s
asleep
and
the
third
is
seeing
pilgrims
on
their
way
mutters
the
stranger
capital
watchmen
they
are
worth
their
salary
ye
es
brother
thieves
have
always
been
cleverer
than
watchmen
stand
still
don
t
stir
five
minutes
ten
minutes
pass
in
silence
all
at
once
the
wind
brings
the
sound
of
a
whistle
well
now
you
can
go
says
the
stranger
releasing
the
watchman
s
arm
go
and
thank
god
you
are
alive
the
stranger
gives
a
whistle
too
runs
away
from
the
gate
and
the
watchman
hears
him
leap
over
the
ditch
with
a
foreboding
of
something
very
dreadful
in
his
heart
the
watchman
still
trembling
with
terror
opens
the
gate
irresolutely
and
runs
back
with
his
eyes
shut
at
the
turning
into
the
main
avenue
he
hears
hurried
footsteps
and
someone
asks
him
in
a
hissing
voice
is
that
you
timofey
where
is
mitka
and
after
running
the
whole
length
of
the
main
avenue
he
notices
a
little
dim
light
in
the
darkness
the
nearer
he
gets
to
the
light
the
more
frightened
he
is
and
the
stronger
his
foreboding
of
evil
it
looks
as
though
the
light
were
in
the
church
he
thinks
and
how
can
it
have
come
there
save
me
and
have
mercy
on
me
queen
of
heaven
and
that
it
is
the
watchman
stands
for
a
minute
before
the
broken
window
and
looks
with
horror
towards
the
altar
a
little
wax
candle
which
the
thieves
had
forgotten
to
put
out
flickers
in
the
wind
that
bursts
in
at
the
window
and
throws
dim
red
patches
of
light
on
the
vestments
flung
about
and
a
cupboard
overturned
on
the
floor
on
numerous
footprints
near
the
high
altar
and
the
altar
of
offerings
a
little
time
passes
and
the
howling
wind
sends
floating
over
the
churchyard
the
hurried
uneven
clangs
of
the
alarm
bell
in
the
court
at
the
district
town
of
n
in
the
cinnamon
coloured
government
house
in
which
the
zemstvo
the
sessional
meetings
of
the
justices
of
the
peace
the
rural
board
the
liquor
board
the
military
board
and
many
others
sit
by
turns
the
circuit
court
was
in
session
on
one
of
the
dull
days
of
autumn
of
the
above
mentioned
cinnamon
coloured
house
a
local
official
had
wittily
observed
here
is
justitia
here
is
policia
here
is
militia
a
regular
boarding
school
of
high
born
young
ladies
but
as
the
saying
is
too
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
and
probably
that
is
why
the
house
strikes
oppresses
and
overwhelms
a
fresh
unofficial
visitor
with
its
dismal
barrack
like
appearance
its
decrepit
condition
and
the
complete
absence
of
any
kind
of
comfort
external
or
internal
even
on
the
brightest
spring
days
it
seems
wrapped
in
a
dense
shade
and
on
clear
moonlight
nights
when
the
trees
and
the
little
dwelling
houses
merged
in
one
blur
of
shadow
seem
plunged
in
quiet
slumber
it
alone
absurdly
and
inappropriately
towers
an
oppressive
mass
of
stone
above
the
modest
landscape
spoils
the
general
harmony
and
keeps
sleepless
vigil
as
though
it
could
not
escape
from
burdensome
memories
of
past
unforgiven
sins
inside
it
is
like
a
barn
and
extremely
unattractive
it
is
strange
to
see
how
readily
these
elegant
lawyers
members
of
committees
and
marshals
of
nobility
who
in
their
own
homes
will
make
a
scene
over
the
slightest
fume
from
the
stove
or
stain
on
the
floor
resign
themselves
here
to
whirring
ventilation
wheels
the
disgusting
smell
of
fumigating
candles
and
the
filthy
forever
perspiring
walls
the
sitting
of
the
circuit
court
began
between
nine
and
ten
the
programme
of
the
day
was
promptly
entered
upon
with
noticeable
haste
the
cases
came
on
one
after
another
and
ended
quickly
like
a
church
service
without
a
choir
so
that
no
mind
could
form
a
complete
picture
of
all
this
parti
coloured
mass
of
faces
movements
words
misfortunes
true
sayings
and
lies
all
racing
by
like
a
river
in
flood
by
two
o
clock
a
great
deal
had
been
done
two
prisoners
had
been
sentenced
to
service
in
convict
battalions
one
of
the
privileged
class
had
been
sentenced
to
deprivation
of
rights
and
imprisonment
one
had
been
acquitted
one
case
had
been
adjourned
at
precisely
two
o
clock
the
presiding
judge
announced
that
the
case
of
the
peasant
nikolay
harlamov
charged
with
the
murder
of
his
wife
would
next
be
heard
the
composition
of
the
court
remained
the
same
as
it
had
been
for
the
preceding
case
except
that
the
place
of
the
defending
counsel
was
filled
by
a
new
personage
a
beardless
young
graduate
in
a
coat
with
bright
buttons
the
president
gave
the
order
bring
in
the
prisoner
but
the
prisoner
who
had
been
got
ready
beforehand
was
already
walking
to
his
bench
he
was
a
tall
thick
set
peasant
of
about
fifty
five
completely
bald
with
an
apathetic
hairy
face
and
a
big
red
beard
he
was
followed
by
a
frail
looking
little
soldier
with
a
gun
just
as
he
was
reaching
the
bench
the
escort
had
a
trifling
mishap
he
stumbled
and
dropped
the
gun
out
of
his
hands
but
caught
it
at
once
before
it
touched
the
ground
knocking
his
knee
violently
against
the
butt
end
as
he
did
so
a
faint
laugh
was
audible
in
the
audience
either
from
the
pain
or
perhaps
from
shame
at
his
awkwardness
the
soldier
flushed
a
dark
red
after
the
customary
questions
to
the
prisoner
the
shuffling
of
the
jury
the
calling
over
and
swearing
in
of
the
witnesses
the
reading
of
the
charge
began
the
narrow
chested
pale
faced
secretary
far
too
thin
for
his
uniform
and
with
sticking
plaster
on
his
check
read
it
in
a
low
thick
bass
rapidly
like
a
sacristan
without
raising
or
dropping
his
voice
as
though
afraid
of
exerting
his
lungs
he
was
seconded
by
the
ventilation
wheel
whirring
indefatigably
behind
the
judge
s
table
and
the
result
was
a
sound
that
gave
a
drowsy
narcotic
character
to
the
stillness
of
the
hall
the
president
a
short
sighted
man
not
old
but
with
an
extremely
exhausted
face
sat
in
his
armchair
without
stirring
and
held
his
open
hand
near
his
brow
as
though
screening
his
eyes
from
the
sun
to
the
droning
of
the
ventilation
wheel
and
the
secretary
he
meditated
when
the
secretary
paused
for
an
instant
to
take
breath
on
beginning
a
new
page
he
suddenly
started
and
looked
round
at
the
court
with
lustreless
eyes
then
bent
down
to
the
ear
of
the
judge
next
to
him
and
asked
with
a
sigh
are
you
putting
up
at
demyanov
s
matvey
petrovitch
yes
at
demyanov
s
answered
the
other
starting
too
next
time
i
shall
probably
put
up
there
too
it
s
really
impossible
to
put
up
at
tipyakov
s
there
s
noise
and
uproar
all
night
knocking
coughing
children
crying
it
s
impossible
the
assistant
prosecutor
a
fat
well
nourished
dark
man
with
gold
spectacles
with
a
handsome
well
groomed
beard
sat
motionless
as
a
statue
with
his
cheek
propped
on
his
fist
reading
byron
s
cain
his
eyes
were
full
of
eager
attention
and
his
eyebrows
rose
higher
and
higher
with
wonder
from
time
to
time
he
dropped
back
in
his
chair
gazed
without
interest
straight
before
him
for
a
minute
and
then
buried
himself
in
his
reading
again
the
council
for
the
defence
moved
the
blunt
end
of
his
pencil
about
the
table
and
mused
with
his
head
on
one
side
his
youthful
face
expressed
nothing
but
the
frigid
immovable
boredom
which
is
commonly
seen
on
the
face
of
schoolboys
and
men
on
duty
who
are
forced
from
day
to
day
to
sit
in
the
same
place
to
see
the
same
faces
the
same
walls
he
felt
no
excitement
about
the
speech
he
was
to
make
and
indeed
what
did
that
speech
amount
to
on
instructions
from
his
superiors
in
accordance
with
long
established
routine
he
would
fire
it
off
before
the
jurymen
without
passion
or
ardour
feeling
that
it
was
colourless
and
boring
and
then
gallop
through
the
mud
and
the
rain
to
the
station
thence
to
the
town
shortly
to
receive
instructions
to
go
off
again
to
some
district
to
deliver
another
speech
it
was
a
bore
at
first
the
prisoner
turned
pale
and
coughed
nervously
into
his
sleeve
but
soon
the
stillness
the
general
monotony
and
boredom
infected
him
too
he
looked
with
dull
witted
respectfulness
at
the
judges
uniforms
at
the
weary
faces
of
the
jurymen
and
bblinked
calmly
the
surroundings
and
procedure
of
the
court
the
expectation
of
which
had
so
weighed
on
his
soul
while
he
was
awaiting
them
in
prison
now
had
the
most
soothing
effect
on
him
what
he
met
here
was
not
at
all
what
he
could
have
expected
the
charge
of
murder
hung
over
him
and
yet
here
he
met
with
neither
threatening
faces
nor
indignant
looks
nor
loud
phrases
about
retribution
nor
sympathy
for
his
extraordinary
fate
not
one
of
those
who
were
judging
him
looked
at
him
with
interest
or
for
long
the
dingy
windows
and
walls
the
voice
of
the
secretary
the
attitude
of
the
prosecutor
were
all
saturated
with
official
indifference
and
produced
an
atmosphere
of
frigidity
as
though
the
murderer
were
simply
an
official
property
or
as
though
he
were
not
being
judged
by
living
men
but
by
some
unseen
machine
set
going
goodness
knows
how
or
by
whom
the
peasant
reassured
did
not
understand
that
the
men
here
were
as
accustomed
to
the
dramas
and
tragedies
of
life
and
were
as
blunted
by
the
sight
of
them
as
hospital
attendants
are
at
the
sight
of
death
and
that
the
whole
horror
and
hopelessness
of
his
position
lay
just
in
this
mechanical
indifference
it
seemed
that
if
he
were
not
to
sit
quietly
but
to
get
up
and
begin
beseeching
appealing
with
tears
for
their
mercy
bitterly
repenting
that
if
he
were
to
die
of
despair
it
would
all
be
shattered
against
blunted
nerves
and
the
callousness
of
custom
like
waves
against
a
rock
when
the
secretary
finished
the
president
for
some
reason
passed
his
hands
over
the
table
before
him
looked
for
some
time
with
his
eyes
screwed
up
towards
the
prisoner
and
then
asked
speaking
languidly
prisoner
at
the
bar
do
you
plead
guilty
to
having
murdered
your
wife
on
the
evening
of
the
ninth
of
june
no
sir
answered
the
prisoner
getting
up
and
holding
his
gown
over
his
chest
after
this
the
court
proceeded
hurriedly
to
the
examination
of
witnesses
two
peasant
women
and
five
men
and
the
village
policeman
who
had
made
the
enquiry
were
questioned
all
of
them
mud
bespattered
exhausted
with
their
long
walk
and
waiting
in
the
witnesses
room
gloomy
and
dispirited
gave
the
same
evidence
they
testified
that
harlamov
lived
well
with
his
old
woman
like
anyone
else
that
he
never
beat
her
except
when
he
had
had
a
drop
that
on
the
ninth
of
june
when
the
sun
was
setting
the
old
woman
had
been
found
in
the
porch
with
her
skull
broken
that
beside
her
in
a
pool
of
blood
lay
an
axe
when
they
looked
for
nikolay
to
tell
him
of
the
calamity
he
was
not
in
his
hut
or
in
the
streets
they
ran
all
over
the
village
looking
for
him
they
went
to
all
the
pothouses
and
huts
but
could
not
find
him
he
had
disappeared
and
two
days
later
came
of
his
own
accord
to
the
police
office
pale
with
his
clothes
torn
trembling
all
over
he
was
bound
and
put
in
the
lock
up
prisoner
said
the
president
addressing
harlamov
can
not
you
explain
to
the
court
where
you
were
during
the
three
days
following
the
murder
i
was
wandering
about
the
fields
neither
eating
nor
drinking
why
did
you
hide
yourself
if
it
was
not
you
that
committed
the
murder
i
was
frightened
i
was
afraid
i
might
be
judged
guilty
aha
good
sit
down
the
last
to
be
examined
was
the
district
doctor
who
had
made
a
post
mortem
on
the
old
woman
he
told
the
court
all
that
he
remembered
of
his
report
at
the
post
mortem
and
all
that
he
had
succeeded
in
thinking
of
on
his
way
to
the
court
that
morning
the
president
screwed
up
his
eyes
at
his
new
glossy
black
suit
at
his
foppish
cravat
at
his
moving
lips
he
listened
and
in
his
mind
the
languid
thought
seemed
to
spring
up
of
itself
everyone
wears
a
short
jacket
nowadays
why
has
he
had
his
made
long
why
long
and
not
short
the
circumspect
creak
of
boots
was
audible
behind
the
president
s
back
it
was
the
assistant
prosecutor
going
up
to
the
table
to
take
some
papers
mihail
vladimirovitch
said
the
assistant
prosecutor
bending
down
to
the
president
s
ear
amazingly
slovenly
the
way
that
koreisky
conducted
the
investigation
the
prisoner
s
brother
was
not
examined
the
village
elder
was
not
examined
there
s
no
making
anything
out
of
his
description
of
the
hut
it
can
t
be
helped
it
can
t
be
helped
said
the
president
sinking
back
in
his
chair
he
s
a
wreck
dropping
to
bits
by
the
way
whispered
the
assistant
prosecutor
look
at
the
audience
in
the
front
row
the
third
from
the
right
a
face
like
an
actor
s
that
s
the
local
croesus
he
has
a
fortune
of
something
like
fifty
thousand
really
you
wouldn
t
guess
it
from
his
appearance
well
dear
boy
shouldn
t
we
have
a
break
we
will
finish
the
case
for
the
prosecution
and
then
as
you
think
best
well
the
president
raised
his
eyes
to
the
doctor
so
you
consider
that
death
was
instantaneous
yes
in
consequence
of
the
extent
of
the
injury
to
the
brain
substance
when
the
doctor
had
finished
the
president
gazed
into
the
space
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
the
defence
and
suggested
have
you
any
questions
to
ask
the
assistant
prosecutor
shook
his
head
negatively
without
lifting
his
eyes
from
cain
the
counsel
for
the
defence
unexpectedly
stirred
and
clearing
his
throat
asked
tell
me
doctor
can
you
from
the
dimensions
of
the
wound
form
any
theory
as
to
as
to
the
mental
condition
of
the
criminal
that
is
i
mean
does
the
extent
of
the
injury
justify
the
supposition
that
the
accused
was
suffering
from
temporary
aberration
the
president
raised
his
drowsy
indifferent
eyes
to
the
counsel
for
the
defence
the
assistant
prosecutor
tore
himself
from
cain
and
looked
at
the
president
they
merely
looked
but
there
was
no
smile
no
surprise
no
perplexity
their
faces
expressed
nothing
perhaps
the
doctor
hesitated
if
one
considers
the
force
with
which
er
er
er
the
criminal
strikes
the
blow
however
excuse
me
i
don
t
quite
understand
your
question
the
counsel
for
the
defence
did
not
get
an
answer
to
his
question
and
indeed
he
did
not
feel
the
necessity
of
one
it
was
clear
even
to
himself
that
that
question
had
strayed
into
his
mind
and
found
utterance
simply
through
the
effect
of
the
stillness
the
boredom
the
whirring
ventilator
wheels
when
they
had
got
rid
of
the
doctor
the
court
rose
to
examine
the
material
evidences
the
first
thing
examined
was
the
full
skirted
coat
upon
the
sleeve
of
which
there
was
a
dark
brownish
stain
of
blood
harlamov
on
being
questioned
as
to
the
origin
of
the
stain
stated
three
days
before
my
old
woman
s
death
penkov
bled
his
horse
i
was
there
i
was
helping
to
be
sure
and
and
got
smeared
with
it
but
penkov
has
just
given
evidence
that
he
does
not
remember
that
you
were
present
at
the
bleeding
i
can
t
tell
about
that
sit
down
they
proceeded
to
examine
the
axe
with
which
the
old
woman
had
been
murdered
that
s
not
my
axe
the
prisoner
declared
whose
is
it
then
i
can
t
tell
i
hadn
t
an
axe
a
peasant
can
t
get
on
for
a
day
without
an
axe
and
your
neighbour
ivan
timofeyitch
with
whom
you
mended
a
sledge
has
given
evidence
that
it
is
your
axe
i
can
t
say
about
that
but
i
swear
before
god
harlamov
held
out
his
hand
before
him
and
spread
out
the
fingers
before
the
living
god
and
i
don
t
remember
how
long
it
is
since
i
did
have
an
axe
of
my
own
i
did
have
one
like
that
only
a
bit
smaller
but
my
son
prohor
lost
it
two
years
before
he
went
into
the
army
he
drove
off
to
fetch
wood
got
drinking
with
the
fellows
and
lost
it
good
sit
down
this
systematic
distrust
and
disinclination
to
hear
him
probably
irritated
and
offended
harlamov
he
bblinked
and
red
patches
came
out
on
his
cheekbones
i
swear
in
the
sight
of
god
he
went
on
craning
his
neck
forward
if
you
don
t
believe
me
be
pleased
to
ask
my
son
prohor
proshka
what
did
you
do
with
the
axe
he
suddenly
asked
in
a
rough
voice
turning
abruptly
to
the
soldier
escorting
him
where
is
it
it
was
a
painful
moment
everyone
seemed
to
wince
and
as
it
were
shrink
together
the
same
fearful
incredible
thought
flashed
like
lightning
through
every
head
in
the
court
the
thought
of
possibly
fatal
coincidence
and
not
one
person
in
the
court
dared
to
look
at
the
soldier
s
face
everyone
refused
to
trust
his
thought
and
believed
that
he
had
heard
wrong
prisoner
conversation
with
the
guards
is
forbidden
the
president
made
haste
to
say
no
one
saw
the
escort
s
face
and
horror
passed
over
the
hall
unseen
as
in
a
mask
the
usher
of
the
court
got
up
quietly
from
his
place
and
tiptoeing
with
his
hand
held
out
to
balance
himself
went
out
of
the
court
half
a
minute
later
there
came
the
muffled
sounds
and
footsteps
that
accompany
the
change
of
guard
all
raised
their
heads
and
trying
to
look
as
though
nothing
had
happened
went
on
with
their
work
boots
a
piano
tuner
called
murkin
a
close
shaven
man
with
a
yellow
face
with
a
nose
stained
with
snuff
and
cotton
wool
in
his
ears
came
out
of
his
hotel
room
into
the
passage
and
in
a
cracked
voice
cried
semyon
waiter
and
looking
at
his
frightened
face
one
might
have
supposed
that
the
ceiling
had
fallen
in
on
him
or
that
he
had
just
seen
a
ghost
in
his
room
upon
my
word
semyon
he
cried
seeing
the
attendant
running
towards
him
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
i
am
a
rheumatic
delicate
man
and
you
make
me
go
barefoot
why
is
it

don
t
give
me
my
boots
all
this
time
where
are
they
semyon
went
into
murkin
s
room
looked
at
the
place
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
putting
the
boots
he
had
cleaned
and
scratched
his
head
the
boots
were
not
there
where
can
they
be
the
damned
things

room

the
devil

have
taken

to

in
to
a
lady
and
disturb
her
all
through
you
here
if
you
please
through
this
foolishness
i
am
to
wake
up
a
respectable
woman
sighing
and
coughing
murkin
went
to
the
door
of
the
next
room
and
cautiously
tapped
who
s
there
he
heard
a
woman
s
voice
a
minute
later
it
s
i
murkin
began
in
a
plaintive
voice
standing
in
the
attitude
of
a
cavalier
addressing
a
lady
of
the
highest
society
pardon
my
disturbing
you
madam
but
i
am
a
man
in
delicate
health
rheumatic
the
doctors

especially
as

extremely
kind
madam
as
to

boots
there
was
a
sound
of
rustling
of
jumping
off
the
bed
and
the
flapping
of
slippers
after
which
the
door
opened
slightly
and
a
plump
feminine
hand
flung
at
murkin
s
feet
a
pair
of
boots
the
piano
tuner
thanked
her
and
went
into
his
own
room
odd
he
muttered
putting
on
the
boots
it
seems
as
though
this
is
not
the
right
boot

left
boots

foot
i

on
them
and

semyon
picked
up
the
boots
turned
them
over
several
times
before
his
eyes
and
frowned

are
pavel
alexandritch

grumbled

at

left
eye

the
actor

every
tuesday

till

tuesday
he
only
comes
here
on
tuesdays
but
why
are
there
two
boots
for
the
left
foot
asked
the
piano
tuner
picking
up
the
boots
with
an
air
of
disgust
what
god
has
sent
him
that
he
wears
through
poverty
where
is
an
actor
to
get
boots
i
said
to
him
what
boots
pavel
alexandritch
they
are
a
positive
disgrace
and
he
said

he
and
turn
pale
in
those
very
boots
says
he
i
have
played
counts
and
princes
a
queer
lot
artists
that
s
the
only
word
for
them
if
i
were
the
governor
or
anyone
in
command
i
would
get
all
these
actors
together
and
clap
them
all
in
prison
continually
sighing
and
groaning
and
knitting
his
brows
murkin
drew
the
two
left
boots
on
to
his
feet
and
set
off
limping
to
madame
la
g
n
rale
shevelitsyn
s
he
went
about
the
town
all
day
long
tuning
pianos
and
all
day
long
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
was
looking
at
his
feet
and
seeing
his
patched
boots
with
heels
worn
down
at
the
sides
apart
from
his
moral
agonies
he
had
to
suffer
physically
also
the
boots
gave
him
a
corn
in
the
evening
he
was
at
the
theatre
there
was
a
performance
of
bluebeard
it
was
only
just
before
the
last
act
and
then
only
thanks
to
the
good
offices
of
a
man
he
knew
who
played
a
flute
in
the
orchestra
that
he
gained
admittance
behind
the
scenes
going
to
the
men
s
dressing
room
he
found
there
all
the
male
performers
some
were
changing
their
clothes
others
were
painting
their
faces
others
were
smoking
bluebeard
was
standing
with
king
bobesh
showing
him
a
revolver
you
had
better
buy
it
said
bluebeard
i
bought
it
at
kursk
a
bargain
for
eight
roubles
but
there
i
will
let
you
have
it
for
six
a
wonderfully
good
one
steady
it
s
loaded
you
know
can
i
see
mr
blistanov
the
piano
tuner
asked
as
he
went
in
i
am
he
said
bluebeard
turning
to
him
what
do
you
want
excuse
my
troubling
you
sir
began
the
piano
tuner
in
an
imploring
voice
but
believe
me
i
am
a
man
in
delicate
health
rheumatic
the
doctors
have
ordered
me
to
keep
my
feet
warm
but
speaking
plainly
what
do
you
want
you
see
said
the
piano
tuner
addressing
bluebeard
er
you
stayed
last
night
at
buhteyev
s
furnished
apartments

this
nonsense
said
king
bobesh
with
a
grin
my
wife

64
your
wife
sir
delighted
murkin
smiled
it
was
she
your
good
lady
who
gave
me
this
gentleman
s
boots
after
this
gentleman
the
piano
tuner
indicated
blistanov
had
gone
away
i
missed
my
boots
i
called
the
waiter
you
know
and
he
said
i
left
your
boots
in
the
next
room
by
mistake
being
in
a
state
of
intoxication
he
left
my
boots
as
well
as
yours
at
64
said
murkin
turning
to
blistanov
and
when
you
left
this
gentleman
s
lady
you
put
on
mine
what
are
you
talking
about
said
blistanov
and
he
scowled
have
you
come
here
to
libel
me
not
at
all
sir
god
forbid
you
misunderstand
me
what
am
i
talking
about

t
you
when
last
night

said
murkin
in
great
confusion
sitting
down
and
taking
off
the
boots
i
did
not
see
you
but
this
gentleman
s
lady
threw
out
your
boots
here
to
me
instead
of
mine
what
right
have
you
sir
to
make
such
assertions
i
say
nothing
about
myself
but
you
are
slandering
a
woman
and
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
too
a
fearful
hubbub
arose
behind
the
scenes
king
bobesh
the
injured
husband
suddenly
turned
crimson
and
brought
his
fist
down
upon
the
table
with
such
violence
that
two
actresses
in
the
next
dressing
room
felt
faint
and
you
believe
it
cried
bluebeard
you
believe
this
worthless
rascal
o
oh
would
you
like
me
to
kill
him
like
a
dog
would
you
like
it
i
will
turn
him
into
a
beefsteak
i
ll
blow
his
brains
out
and
all
the
persons
who
were
promenading
that
evening
in
the
town
park
by
the
summer
theatre
describe
to
this
day
how
just
before
the
fourth
act
they
saw
a
man
with
bare
feet
a
yellow
face
and
terror
stricken
eyes
dart
out
of
the
theatre
and
dash
along
the
principal
avenue
he
was
pursued
by
a
man
in
the
costume
of
bluebeard
armed
with
a
revolver
what
happened
later
no
one
saw
all
that
is
known
is
that
murkin
was
confined
to
his
bed
for
a
fortnight
after
his
acquaintance
with
blistanov
and
that
to
the
words
i
am
a
man

to
adding

at
night

kuldarov
with

through
all
the
rooms
his
parents

finishing
the
last

mitya
put
on
his
cap
with
its
cockade
and
joyful
and
triumphant
ran
into
the
street
ladies
fyodor
petrovitch
the
director
of
elementary
schools
in
the
n
district
who
considered
himself
a
just
and
generous
man
was
one
day
interviewing
in
his
office
a
schoolmaster
called
vremensky
no
mr
vremensky
he
was
saying
your
retirement
is
inevitable
you
can
not
continue
your
work
as
a
schoolmaster
with
a
voice
like
that
how
did
you
come
to
lose
it
i
drank
cold
beer
when
i
was
in
a
perspiration
hissed
the
schoolmaster
what
a
pity
after
a
man
has
served
fourteen
years
such
a
calamity
all
at
once
the
idea
of
a
career
being
ruined
by
such
a
trivial
thing
what
are
you
intending
to
do
now
the
schoolmaster
made
no
answer
are
you
a
family
man
asked
the
director
a
wife
and
two
children
your
excellency
hissed
the
schoolmaster
a
silence
followed
the
director
got
up
from
the
table
and
walked
to
and
fro
in
perturbation
i
can
not
think
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
you
he
said
a
teacher
you
can
not
be
and
you
are
not
yet
entitled
to
a
pension
to
abandon
you
to
your
fate
and
leave
you
to
do
the
best
you
can
is
rather
awkward
we
look
on
you
as
one
of
our
men
you
have
served
fourteen
years
so
it
is
our
business
to
help
you
but
how
are
we
to
help
you
what
can
i
do
for
you
put
yourself
in
my
place
what
can
i
do
for
you
a
silence
followed
the
director
walked
up
and
down
still
thinking
and
vremensky
overwhelmed
by
his
trouble
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
he
too
thought
all
at
once
the
director
began
beaming
and
even
snapped
his
fingers
i
wonder
i
did
not
think
of
it
before
he
began
rapidly
listen
this
is
what
i
can
offer
you
next
week
our
secretary
at
the
home
is
retiring
if
you
like
you
can
have
his
place
there
you
are
vremensky
not
expecting
such
good
fortune
beamed
too
that
s
capital
said
the
director
write
the
application
to
day
dismissing
vremensky
fyodor
petrovitch
felt
relieved
and
even
gratified
the
bent
figure
of
the
hissing
schoolmaster
was
no
longer
confronting
him
and
it
was
agreeable
to
recognize
that
in
offering
a
vacant
post
to
vremensky
he
had
acted
fairly
and
conscientiously
like
a
good
hearted
and
thoroughly
decent
person
but
this
agreeable
state
of
mind
did
not
last
long
when
he
went
home
and
sat
down
to
dinner
his
wife
nastasya
ivanovna
said
suddenly
oh
yes
i
was
almost
forgetting
nina
sergeyevna
came
to
see
me
yesterday
and
begged
for
your
interest
on
behalf
of
a
young
man
i
am
told
there
is
a
vacancy
in
our
home
yes
but
the
post
has
already
been
promised
to
someone
else
said
the
director
and
he
frowned
and
you
know
my
rule
i
never
give
posts
through
patronage
i
know
but
for
nina
sergeyevna
i
imagine
you
might
make
an
exception
she
loves
us
as
though
we
were
relations
and
we
have
never
done
anything
for
her
and
don
t
think
of
refusing
fedya
you
will
wound
both
her
and
me
with
your
whims
who
is
it
that
she
is
recommending
polzuhin
what
polzuhin
is
it
that
fellow
who
played
tchatsky
at
the
party
on
new
year
s
day
is
it
that
gentleman
not
on
any
account
the
director
left
off
eating
not
on
any
account
he
repeated
heaven
preserve
us
but
why
not
understand
my
dear
that
if
a
young
man
does
not
set
to
work
directly
but
through
women
he
must
be
good
for
nothing
why
doesn
t
he
come
to
me
himself
after
dinner
the
director
lay
on
the
sofa
in
his
study
and
began
reading
the
letters
and
newspapers
he
had
received
dear
fyodor
petrovitch
wrote
the
wife
of
the
mayor
of
the
town
you
once
said
that
i
knew
the
human
heart
and
understood
people
now
you
have
an
opportunity
of
verifying
this
in
practice
k
n
polzuhin
whom
i
know
to
be
an
excellent
young
man
will
call
upon
you
in
a
day
or
two
to
ask
you
for
the
post
of
secretary
at
our
home
he
is
a
very
nice
youth
if
you
take
an
interest
in
him
you
will
be
convinced
of
it
and
so
on
on
no
account
was
the
director
s
comment
heaven
preserve
me
after
that
not
a
day
passed
without
the
director
s
receiving
letters
recommending
polzuhin
one
fine
morning
polzuhin
himself
a
stout
young
man
with
a
close
shaven
face
like
a
jockey
s
in
a
new
black
suit
made
his
appearance
i
see
people
on
business
not
here
but
at
the
office
said
the
director
drily
on
hearing
his
request
forgive
me
your
excellency
but
our
common
acquaintances
advised
me
to
come
here
h
m
growled
the
director
looking
with
hatred
at
the
pointed
toes
of
the
young
man
s
shoes
to
the
best
of
my
belief
your
father
is
a
man
of
property
and
you
are
not
in
want
he
said
what
induces
you
to
ask
for
this
post
the
salary
is
very
trifling
it
s
not
for
the
sake
of
the
salary
it
s
a
government
post
any
way
h
m
it
strikes
me
that
within
a
month
you
will
be
sick
of
the
job
and
you
will
give
it
up
and
meanwhile
there
are
candidates
for
whom
it
would
be
a
career
for
life
there
are
poor
men
for
whom
i
shan
t
get
sick
of
it
your
excellency
polzuhin
interposed
honour
bright
i
will
do
my
best
it
was
too
much
for
the
director
tell
me
he
said
smiling
contemptuously
why
was
it
you
didn
t
apply
to
me
direct
but
thought
fitting
instead
to
trouble
ladies
as
a
preliminary
i
didn
t
know
that
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
you
polzuhin
answered
and
he
was
embarrassed
but
your
excellency
if
you
attach
no
significance
to
letters
of
recommendation
i
can
give
you
a
testimonial
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
the
director
at
the
bottom
of
the
testimonial
which
was
written
in
official
language
and
handwriting
stood
the
signature
of
the
governor
everything
pointed
to
the
governor
s
having
signed
it
unread
simply
to
get
rid
of
some
importunate
lady
there
s
nothing
for
it
i
bow
to
his
authority
i
obey
said
the
director
reading
the
testimonial
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
send
in
your
application
to
morrow
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
and
when
polzuhin
had
gone
out
the
director
abandoned
himself
to
a
feeling
of
repulsion
sneak
he
hissed
pacing
from
one
corner
to
the
other
he
has
got
what
he
wanted
one
way
or
the
other
the
good
for
nothing
toady
making
up
to
the
ladies
reptile
creature
the
director
spat
loudly
in
the
direction
of
the
door
by
which
polzuhin
had
departed
and
was
immediately
overcome
with
embarrassment
for
at
that
moment
a
lady
the
wife
of
the
superintendent
of
the
provincial
treasury
walked
in
at
the
door
i
ve
come
for
a
tiny
minute
a
tiny
minute
began
the
lady
sit
down
friend
and
listen
to
me
attentively
well
i
ve
been
told
you
have
a
post
vacant
to
day
or
to
morrow
you
will
receive
a
visit
from
a
young
man
called
polzuhin
the
lady
chattered
on
while
the
director
gazed
at
her
with
lustreless
stupefied
eyes
like
a
man
on
the
point
of
fainting
gazed
and
smiled
from
politeness
and
the
next
day
when
vremensky
came
to
his
office
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
director
could
bring
himself
to
tell
the
truth
he
hesitated
was
incoherent
and
could
not
think
how
to
begin
or
what
to
say
he
wanted
to
apologize
to
the
schoolmaster
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
but
his
tongue
halted
like
a
drunkard
s
his
ears
burned
and
he
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
with
vexation
and
resentment
that
he
should
have
to
play
such
an
absurd
part
in
his
own
office
before
his
subordinate
he
suddenly
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
leaped
up
and
shouted
angrily
i
have
no
post
for
you
i
have
not
and
that
s
all
about
it
leave
me
in
peace
don
t
worry
me
be
so
good
as
to
leave
me
alone
and
he
walked
out
of
the
office
a
peculiar
man
between
twelve
and
one
at
night
a
tall
gentleman
wearing
a
top
hat
and
a
coat
with
a
hood
stops
before
the
door
of
marya
petrovna
koshkin
a
midwife
and
an
old
maid
neither
face
nor
hand
can
be
distinguished
in
the
autumn
darkness
but
in
the
very
manner
of
his
coughing
and
the
ringing
of
the
bell
a
certain
solidity
positiveness
and
even
impressiveness
can
be
discerned
after
the
third
ring
the
door
opens
and
marya
petrovna
herself
appears
she
has
a
man
s
overcoat
flung
on
over
her
white
petticoat
the
little
lamp
with
the
green
shade
which
she
holds
in
her
hand
throws
a
greenish
light
over
her
sleepy
freckled
face
her
scraggy
neck
and
the
lank
reddish
hair
that
strays
from
under
her
cap
can
i
see
the
midwife
asks
the
gentleman
i
am
the
midwife
what
do
you
want
the
gentleman
walks
into
the
entry
and
marya
petrovna
sees
facing
her
a
tall
well
made
man
no
longer
young
but
with
a
handsome
severe
face
and
bushy
whiskers
i
am
a
collegiate
assessor
my
name
is
kiryakov
he
says
i
came
to
fetch
you
to
my
wife
only
please
make
haste
very
good
the
midwife
assents
i
ll
dress
at
once
and
i
must
trouble
you
to
wait
for
me
in
the
parlour
kiryakov
takes
off
his
overcoat
and
goes
into
the
parlour
the
greenish
light
of
the
lamp
lies
sparsely
on
the
cheap
furniture
in
patched
white
covers
on
the
pitiful
flowers
and
the
posts
on
which
ivy
is
trained
there
is
a
smell
of
geranium
and
carbolic
the
little
clock
on
the
wall
ticks
timidly
as
though
abashed
at
the
presence
of
a
strange
man
i
am
ready
says
marya
petrovna
coming
into
the
room
five
minutes
later
dressed
washed
and
ready
for
action
let
us
go
yes
you
must
make
haste
says
kiryakov
and
by
the
way
it
is
not
out
of
place
to
enquire
what
do
you
ask
for
your
services
i
really
don
t
know
says
marya
petrovna
with
an
embarrassed
smile
as
much
as
you
will
give
no
i
don
t
like
that
says
kiryakov
looking
coldly
and
steadily
at
the
midwife
an
arrangement
beforehand
is
best
i
don
t
want
to
take
advantage
of
you
and
you
don
t
want
to
take
advantage
of
me
to
avoid
misunderstandings
it
is
more
sensible
for
us
to
make
an
arrangement
beforehand
i
really
don
t
know
there
is
no
fixed
price
i
work
myself
and
am
accustomed
to
respect
the
work
of
others
i
don
t
like
injustice
it
will
be
equally
unpleasant
to
me
if
i
pay
you
too
little
or
if
you
demand
from
me
too
much
and
so
i
insist
on
your
naming
your
charge
well
there
are
such
different
charges
h
m
in
view
of
your
hesitation
which
i
fail
to
understand
i
am
constrained
to
fix
the
sum
myself
i
can
give
you
two
roubles
good
gracious
upon
my
word
says
marya
petrovna
turning
crimson
and
stepping
back
i
am
really
ashamed
rather
than
take
two
roubles
i
will
come
for
nothing
five
roubles
if
you
like
two
roubles
not
a
kopeck
more
i
don
t
want
to
take
advantage
of
you
but
i
do
not
intend
to
be
overcharged
as
you
please
but
i
am
not
coming
for
two
roubles
but
by
law
you
have
not
the
right
to
refuse
very
well
i
will
come
for
nothing
i
won
t
have
you
for
nothing
all
work
ought
to
receive
remuneration
i
work
myself
and
i
understand
that
i
won
t
come
for
two
roubles
marya
petrovna
answers
mildly
i
ll
come
for
nothing
if
you
like
in
that
case
i
regret
that
i
have
troubled
you
for
nothing
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
good
bye
well
you
are
a
man
says
marya
petrovna
seeing
him
into
the
entry
i
will
come
for
three
roubles
if
that
will
satisfy
you
kiryakov
frowns
and
ponders
for
two
full
minutes
looking
with
concentration
on
the
floor
then
he
says
resolutely
no
and
goes
out
into
the
street
the
astonished
and
disconcerted
midwife
fastens
the
door
after
him
and
goes
back
into
her
bedroom
he
s
good
looking
respectable
but
how
queer
god
bless
the
man
she
thinks
as
she
gets
into
bed
but
in
less
than
half
an
hour
she
hears
another
ring
she
gets
up
and
sees
the
same
kiryakov
again
extraordinary
the
way
things
are
mismanaged
neither
the
chemist
nor
the
police
nor
the
house
porters
can
give
me
the
address
of
a
midwife
and
so
i
am
under
the
necessity
of
assenting
to
your
terms
i
will
give
you
three
roubles
but
i
warn
you
beforehand
that
when
i
engage
servants
or
receive
any
kind
of
services
i
make
an
arrangement
beforehand
in
order
that
when
i
pay
there
may
be
no
talk
of
extras
tips
or
anything
of
the
sort
everyone
ought
to
receive
what
is
his
due
marya
petrovna
has
not
listened
to
kiryakov
for
long
but
already
she
feels
that
she
is
bored
and
repelled
by
him
that
his
even
measured
speech
lies
like
a
weight
on
her
soul
she
dresses
and
goes
out
into
the
street
with
him
the
air
is
still
but
cold
and
the
sky
is
so
overcast
that
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
is
hardly
visible
the
sloshy
snow
squelches
under
their
feet
the
midwife
looks
intently
but
does
not
see
a
cab
i
suppose
it
is
not
far
she
asks
no
not
far
kiryakov
answers
grimly
they
walk
down
one
turning
a
second
a
third
kiryakov
strides
along
and
even
in
his
step
his
respectability
and
positiveness
is
apparent
what
awful
weather
the
midwife
observes
to
him
but
he
preserves
a
dignified
silence
and
it
is
noticeable
that
he
tries
to
step
on
the
smooth
stones
to
avoid
spoiling
his
goloshes
at
last
after
a
long
walk
the
midwife
steps
into
the
entry
from
which
she
can
see
a
big
decently
furnished
drawing
room
there
is
not
a
soul
in
the
rooms
even
in
the
bedroom
where
the
woman
is
lying
in
labour
the
old
women
and
relations
who
flock
in
crowds
to
every
confinement
are
not
to
be
seen
the
cook
rushes
about
alone
with
a
scared
and
vacant
face
there
is
a
sound
of
loud
groans
three
hours
pass
marya
petrovna
sits
by
the
mother
s
bedside
and
whispers
to
her
the
two
women
have
already
had
time
to
make
friends
they
have
got
to
know
each
other
they
gossip
they
sigh
together
you
mustn
t
talk
says
the
midwife
anxiously
and
at
the
same
time
she
showers
questions
on
her
then
the
door
opens
and
kiryakov
himself
comes
quietly
and
stolidly
into
the
room
he
sits
down
in
the
chair
and
strokes
his
whiskers
silence
reigns
marya
petrovna
looks
timidly
at
his
handsome
passionless
wooden
face
and
waits
for
him
to
begin
to
talk
but
he
remains
absolutely
silent
and
absorbed
in
thought
after
waiting
in
vain
the
midwife
makes
up
her
mind
to
begin
herself
and
utters
a
phrase
commonly
used
at
confinements
well
now
thank
god
there
is
one
human
being
more
in
the
world
yes
that
s
agreeable
said
kiryakov
preserving
the
wooden
expression
of
his
face
though
indeed
on
the
other
hand
to
have
more
children
you
must
have
more
money
the
baby
is
not
born
fed
and
clothed
a
guilty
expression
comes
into
the
mother
s
face
as
though
she
had
brought
a
creature
into
the
world
without
permission
or
through
idle
caprice
kiryakov
gets
up
with
a
sigh
and
walks
with
solid
dignity
out
of
the
room
what
a
man
bless
him
says
the
midwife
to
the
mother
he
s
so
stern
and
does
not
smile
the
mother
tells
her
that
he
is
always
like
that
he
is
honest
fair
prudent
sensibly
economical
but
all
that
to
such
an
exceptional
degree
that
simple
mortals
feel
suffocated
by
it
his
relations
have
parted
from
him
the
servants
will
not
stay
more
than
a
month
they
have
no
friends
his
wife
and
children
are
always
on
tenterhooks
from
terror
over
every
step
they
take
he
does
not
shout
at
them
nor
beat
them
his
virtues
are
far
more
numerous
than
his
defects
but
when
he
goes
out
of
the
house
they
all
feel
better
and
more
at
ease
why
it
is
so
the
woman
herself
can
not
say
the
basins
must
be
properly
washed
and
put
away
in
the
store
cupboard
says
kiryakov
coming
into
the
bedroom
these
bottles
must
be
put
away
too
they
may
come
in
handy
what
he
says
is
very
simple
and
ordinary
but
the
midwife
for
some
reason
feels
flustered
she
begins
to
be
afraid
of
the
man
and
shudders
every
time
she
hears
his
footsteps
in
the
morning
as
she
is
preparing
to
depart
she
sees
kiryakov
s
little
son
a
pale
close
cropped
schoolboy
in
the
dining
room
drinking
his
tea
kiryakov
is
standing
opposite
him
saying
in
his
flat
even
voice
you
know
how
to
eat
you
must
know
how
to
work
too
you
have
just
swallowed
a
mouthful
but
have
not
probably
reflected
that
that
mouthful
costs
money
and
money
is
obtained
by
work
you
must
eat
and
reflect
the
midwife
looks
at
the
boy
s
dull
face
and
it
seems
to
her
as
though
the
very
air
is
heavy
that
a
little
more
and
the
very
walls
will
fall
unable
to
endure
the
crushing
presence
of
the
peculiar
man
beside
herself
with
terror
and
by
now
feeling
a
violent
hatred
for
the
man
marya
petrovna
gathers
up
her
bundles
and
hurriedly
departs
half
way
home
she
remembers
that
she
has
forgotten
to
ask
for
her
three
roubles
but
after
stopping
and
thinking
for
a
minute
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
she
goes
on
at
the
barber
s
morning
it
is
not
yet
seven
o
clock
but
makar
kuzmitch
blyostken
s
shop
is
already
open
the
barber
himself
an
unwashed
greasy
but
foppishly
dressed
youth
of
three
and
twenty
is
busy
clearing
up
there
is
really
nothing
to
be
cleared
away
but
he
is
perspiring
with
his
exertions
in
one
place
he
polishes
with
a
rag
in
another
he
scrapes
with
his
finger
or
catches
a
bug
and
brushes
it
off
the
wall
the
barber
s
shop
is
small
narrow
and
unclean
the
log
walls
are
hung
with
paper
suggestive
of
a
cabman
s
faded
shirt
between
the
two
dingy
perspiring
windows
there
is
a
thin
creaking
rickety
door
above
it
green
from
the
damp
a
bell
which
trembles
and
gives
a
sickly
ring
of
itself
without
provocation
glance
into
the
looking
glass
which
hangs
on
one
of
the
walls
and
it
distorts
your
countenance
in
all
directions
in
the
most
merciless
way
the
shaving
and
haircutting
is
done
before
this
looking
glass
on
the
little
table
as
greasy
and
unwashed
as
makar
kuzmitch
himself
there
is
everything
combs
scissors
razors
a
ha
porth
of
wax
for
the
moustache
a
ha
porth
of
powder
a
ha
porth
of
much
watered
eau
de
cologne
and
indeed
the
whole
barber
s
shop
is
not
worth
more
than
fifteen
kopecks
there
is
a
squeaking
sound
from
the
invalid
bell
and
an
elderly
man
in
a
tanned
sheepskin
and
high
felt
over
boots
walks
into
the
shop
his
head
and
neck
are
wrapped
in
a
woman
s
shawl
this
is
erast
ivanitch
yagodov
makar
kuzmitch
s
godfather
at
one
time
he
served
as
a
watchman
in
the
consistory
now
he
lives
near
the
red
pond
and
works
as
a
locksmith
makarushka
good

says
to
makar
kuzmitch
who
is
absorbed
in
tidying
up
they
kiss
each
other
yagodov
drags
his
shawl
off
his
head
crosses
himself
and
sits
down
what
a
long
way
it
is
he
says
sighing
and
clearing
his
throat
it
s
no
joke
from
the
red
pond
to
the
kaluga
gate
how
are
you

a

he
will
do
it
better
and
he
won

take
anything
for

rather
far
that

a
walk

it
with
pleasure
please
sit
down
with
a
scrape
of
his
foot
makar
kuzmitch
indicates
a
chair
yagodov
sits
down
and
looks
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
is
apparently
pleased
with
his
reflection
the
looking
glass
displays
a
face
awry
with
kalmuck
lips
a
broad
blunt
nose
and
eyes
in
the
forehead
makar
kuzmitch
puts
round
his
client
s
shoulders
a
white
sheet
with
yellow
spots
on
it
and
begins
snipping
with
the
scissors
i
ll
shave
you
clean
to
the
skin
he
says
to
be
sure
so
that
i
may
look
like
a
tartar

a
bomb
the
hair
will
grow
all
the
thicker

he
s
a
good
fellow
cold
drops
of
perspiration
come
on
the
face
of
makar
kuzmitch
he
puts
the
scissors
down
on
the
table
and
begins
rubbing
his
nose
with

small
come

stopping
makar
kuzmitch
is
silent
and
remains
motionless
then
he
takes
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
begins
to
cry
come
what
is
it
erast
ivanitch
comforts

minute

on

shaking

to
morrow
right
you
calm
yourself
and
i
will
come
to
you
early
in
the
morning
erast
ivanitch
has
half
his
head
shaven
to
the
skin
and
looks
like
a
convict
it
is
awkward
to
be
left
with
a
head
like
that
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
he
wraps
his
head
in
the
shawl
and
walks
out
of
the
barber
s
shop
left
alone
makar
kuzmitch
sits
down
and
goes
on
quietly
weeping
early
next
morning
erast
ivanitch
comes
again
what
do
you
want
makar
kuzmitch
asks
him
coldly
finish
cutting
my
hair
makarushka
there
is
half
the
head
left
to
do
kindly
give
me
the
money
in
advance
i
won
t
cut
it
for
nothing
without
saying
a
word
erast
ivanitch
goes
out
and
to
this
day
his
hair
is
long
on
one
side
of
the
head
and
short
on
the
other
he
regards
it
as
extravagance
to
pay
for
having
his
hair
cut
and
is
waiting
for
the
hair
to
grow
of
itself
on
the
shaven
side
he
danced
at
the
wedding
in
that
condition
an
inadvertence
pyotr
petrovitch
strizhin
the
nephew
of
madame
ivanov
the
colonel
s
widow
the
man
whose
new
goloshes
were
stolen
last
year
came
home
from
a
christening
party
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
avoid
waking
the
household
he
took
off
his
things
in
the
lobby
made
his
way
on
tiptoe
to
his
room
holding
his
breath
and
began
getting
ready
for
bed
without
lighting
a
candle
strizhin
leads
a
sober
and
regular
life
he
has
a
sanctimonious
expression
of
face
he
reads
nothing
but
religious
and
edifying
books
but
at
the
christening
party
in
his
delight
that
lyubov
spiridonovna
had
passed
through
her
confinement
successfully
he
had
permitted
himself
to
drink
four
glasses
of
vodka
and
a
glass
of
wine
the
taste
of
which
suggested
something
midway
between
vinegar
and
castor
oil
spirituous
liquors
are
like
sea
water
and
glory
the
more
you
imbibe
of
them
the
greater
your
thirst
and
now
as
he
undressed
strizhin
was
aware
of
an
overwhelming
craving
for
drink
i
believe
dashenka
has
some
vodka
in
the
cupboard
in
the
right
hand
corner
he
thought
if
i
drink
one
wine
glassful
she
won
t
notice
it
after
some
hesitation
overcoming
his
fears
strizhin
went
to
the
cupboard
cautiously
opening
the
door
he
felt
in
the
right
hand
corner
for
a
bottle
and
poured
out
a
wine
glassful
put
the
bottle
back
in
its
place
then
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
drank
it
off
and
immediately
something
like
a
miracle
took
place
strizhin
was
flung
back
from
the
cupboard
to
the
chest
with
fearful
force
like
a
bomb
there
were
flashes
before
his
eyes
he
felt
as
though
he
could
not
breathe
and
all
over
his
body
he
had
a
sensation
as
though
he
had
fallen
into
a
marsh
full
of
leeches
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
instead
of
vodka
he
had
swallowed
dynamite
which
blew
up
his
body
the
house
and
the
whole
street
his
head
his
arms
his
legs
all
seemed
to
be
torn
off
and
to
be
flying
away
somewhere
to
the
devil
into
space
for
some
three
minutes
he
lay
on
the
chest
not
moving
and
scarcely
breathing
then
he
got
up
and
asked
himself
where
am
i
the
first
thing
of
which
he
was
clearly
conscious
on
coming
to
himself
was
the
pronounced
smell
of
paraffin
holy
saints
he
thought
in
horror
it
s
paraffin
i
have
drunk
instead
of
vodka
the
thought
that
he
had
poisoned
himself
threw
him
into
a
cold
shiver
then
into
a
fever
that
it
was
really
poison
that
he
had
taken
was
proved
not
only
by
the
smell
in
the
room
but
also
by
the
burning
taste
in
his
mouth
the
flashes
before
his
eyes
the
ringing
in
his
head
and
the
colicky
pain
in
his
stomach
feeling
the
approach
of
death
and
not
buoying
himself
up
with
false
hopes
he
wanted
to
say
good
bye
to
those
nearest
to
him
and
made
his
way
to
dashenka
s
bedroom
being
a
widower
he
had
his
sister
in
law
called
dashenka
an
old
maid
living
in
the
flat
to
keep
house
for
him
dashenka
he
said
in
a
tearful
voice
as
he
went
into
the
bedroom
dear
dashenka
something
grumbled
in
the
darkness
and
uttered
a
deep
sigh
dashenka
eh
what
a
woman
s
voice
articulated
rapidly
is
that
you
pyotr
petrovitch
are
you
back
already
well
what
is
it
what
has
the
baby
been
christened
who
was
godmother
the
godmother
was
natalya
andreyevna
velikosvyetsky
and
the
godfather
pavel
ivanitch
bezsonnitsin
i
i
believe
dashenka
i
am
dying
and
the
baby
has
been
christened
olimpiada
in
honour
of
their
kind
patroness
i
i
have
just
drunk
paraffin
dashenka
what
next
you
don
t
say
they
gave
you
paraffin
there
i
must
own
i
wanted
to
get
a
drink
of
vodka
without
asking
you
and
and
the
lord
chastised
me
by
accident
in
the
dark
i
took
paraffin
what
am
i
to
do
dashenka
hearing
that
the
cupboard
had
been
opened
without
her
permission
grew
more
wide
awake
she
quickly
lighted
a
candle
jumped
out
of
bed
and
in
her
nightgown
a
freckled
bony
figure
in
curl
papers
padded
with
bare
feet
to
the
cupboard
who
told
you
you
might
she
asked
sternly
as
she
scrutinized
the
inside
of
the
cupboard
was
the
vodka
put
there
for
you
i
i
haven
t
drunk
vodka
but
paraffin
dashenka
muttered
strizhin
mopping
the
cold
sweat
on
his
brow
and
what
did
you
want
to
touch
the
paraffin
for
that
s
nothing
to
do
with
you
is
it
is
it
put
there
for
you
or
do
you
suppose
paraffin
costs
nothing
eh
do
you
know
what
paraffin
is
now
do
you
know
dear
dashenka
moaned
strizhin
it
s
a
question
of
life
and
death
and
you
talk
about
money
he
s
drunk
himself
tipsy
and
now
he
pokes
his
nose
into
the
cupboard
cried
dashenka
angrily
slamming
the
cupboard
door
oh
the
monsters
the
tormentors
i
m
a
martyr
a
miserable
woman
no
peace
day
or
night
vipers
basilisks
accursed
herods
may
you
suffer
the
same
in
the
world
to
come
i
am
going
to
morrow
i
am
a
maiden
lady
and
i
won
t
allow
you
to
stand
before
me
in
your
underclothes
how
dare
you
look
at
me
when
i
am
not
dressed
and
she
went
on
and
on
knowing
that
when
dashenka
was
enraged
there
was
no
moving
her
with
prayers
or
vows
or
even
by
firing
a
cannon
strizhin
waved
his
hand
in
despair
dressed
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
doctor
but
a
doctor
is
only
readily
found
when
he
is
not
wanted
after
running
through
three
streets
and
ringing
five
times
at
dr
tchepharyants
s
and
seven
times
at
dr
bultyhin
s
strizhin
raced
off
to
a
chemist
s
shop
thinking
possibly
the
chemist
could
help
him
there
after
a
long
interval
a
little
dark
and
curly
headed
chemist
came
out
to
him
in
his
dressing
gown
with
drowsy
eyes
and
such
a
wise
and
serious
face
that
it
was
positively
terrifying
what
do
you
want
he
asked
in
a
tone
in
which
only
very
wise
and
dignified
chemists
of
jewish
persuasion
can
speak
for
god
s
sake
i
entreat
you
said
strizhin
breathlessly
give
me
something
i
have
just
accidentally
drunk
paraffin
i
am
dying
i
beg
you
not
to
excite
yourself
and
to
answer
the
questions
i
am
about
to
put
to
you
the
very
fact
that
you
are
excited
prevents
me
from
understanding
you
you
have
drunk
paraffin
yes
yes
paraffin
please
save
me
the
chemist
went
coolly
and
gravely
to
the
desk
opened
a
book
became
absorbed
in
reading
it
after
reading
a
couple
of
pages
he
shrugged
one
shoulder
and
then
the
other
made
a
contemptuous
grimace
and
after
thinking
for
a
minute
went
into
the
adjoining
room
the
clock
struck
four
and
when
it
pointed
to
ten
minutes
past
the
chemist
came
back
with
another
book
and
again
plunged
into
reading
h
m
he
said
as
though
puzzled
the
very
fact
that
you
feel
unwell
shows
you
ought
to
apply
to
a
doctor
not
a
chemist
but
i
have
been
to
the
doctors
already
i
could
not
ring
them
up
h
m
you
don
t
regard
us
chemists
as
human
beings
and
disturb
our
rest
even
at
four
o
clock
at
night
though
every
dog
every
cat
can
rest
in
peace
you
don
t
try
to
understand
anything
and
to
your
thinking
we
are
not
people
and
our
nerves
are
like
cords
strizhin
listened
to
the
chemist
heaved
a
sigh
and
went
home
so
i
am
fated
to
die
he
thought
and
in
his
mouth
was
a
burning
and
a
taste
of
paraffin
there
were
twinges
in
his
stomach
and
a
sound
of
boom
boom
boom
in
his
ears
every
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
end
was
near
that
his
heart
was
no
longer
beating
returning
home
he
made
haste
to
write
let
no
one
be
blamed
for
my
death
then
he
said
his
prayers
lay
down
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
over
his
head
he
lay
awake
till
morning
expecting
death
and
all
the
time
he
kept
fancying
how
his
grave
would
be
covered
with
fresh
green
grass
and
how
the
birds
would
twitter
over
it
and
in
the
morning
he
was
sitting
on
his
bed
saying
with
a
smile
to
dashenka
one
who
leads
a
steady
and
regular
life
dear
sister
is
unaffected
by
any
poison
take
me
for
example
i
have
been
on
the
verge
of
death
i
was
dying
and
in
agony
yet
now
i
am
all
right
there
is
only
a
burning
in
my
mouth
and
a
soreness
in
my
throat
but
i
am
all
right
all
over
thank
god
and
why
it
s
because
of
my
regular
life
no
it
s
because
it
s
inferior
paraffin
sighed
dashenka
thinking
of
the
household
expenses
and
gazing
into
space
the
man
at
the
shop
could
not
have
given
me
the
best
quality
but
that
at
three
farthings
i
am
a
martyr
i
am
a
miserable
woman
you
monsters
may
you
suffer
the
same
in
the
world
to
come
accursed
herods
and
she
went
on
and
on
the
album
kraterov
the
titular
councillor
as
thin
and
slender
as
the
admiralty
spire
stepped
forward
and
addressing
zhmyhov
said
your
excellency
moved
and
touched
to
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
by
the
way
you
have
ruled
us
during
long
years
and
by
your
fatherly
care
during
the
course
of
more
than
ten
years
zakusin
prompted
during
the
course
of
more
than
ten
years
we
your
subordinates
on
this
so
memorable
for
us
er
day
beg
your
excellency
to
accept
in
token
of
our
respect
and
profound
gratitude
this
album
with
our
portraits
in
it
and
express
our
hope
that
for
the
duration
of
your
distinguished
life
that
for
long
long
years
to
come
to
your
dying
day
you
may
not
abandon
us
with
your
fatherly
guidance
in
the
path
of
justice
and
progress
added
zakusin
wiping
from
his
brow
the
perspiration
that
had
suddenly
appeared
on
it
he
was
evidently
longing
to
speak
and
in
all
probability
had
a
speech
ready
and
he
wound
up
may
your
standard
fly
for
long
long
years
in
the
career
of
genius
industry
and
social
self
consciousness
a
tear
trickled
down
the
wrinkled
left
cheek
of
zhmyhov
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
i
did
not
expect
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
going
to
celebrate
my
modest
jubilee
i
am
touched
indeed
very
much
so
i
shall
not
forget
this
moment
to
my
dying
day
and
believe
me
believe
me
friends
that
no
one
is
so
desirous
of
your
welfare
as
i
am
and
if
there
has
been
anything
it
was
for
your
benefit
zhmyhov
the
actual
civil
councillor
kissed
the
titular
councillor
kraterov
who
had
not
expected
such
an
honour
and
turned
pale
with
delight
then
the
chief
made
a
gesture
that
signified
that
he
could
not
speak
for
emotion
and
shed
tears
as
though
an
expensive
album
had
not
been
presented
to
him
but
on
the
contrary
taken
from
him
then
when
he
had
a
little
recovered
and
said
a
few
more
words
full
of
feeling
and
given
everyone
his
hand
to
shake
he
went
downstairs
amid
loud
and
joyful
cheers
got
into
his
carriage
and
drove
off
followed
by
their
blessings
as
he
sat
in
his
carriage
he
was
aware
of
a
flood
of
joyous
feelings
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
and
once
more
he
shed
tears
at
home
new
delights
awaited
him
there
his
family
his
friends
and
acquaintances
had
prepared
him
such
an
ovation
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
really
had
been
of
very
great
service
to
his
country
and
that
if
he
had
never
existed
his
country
would
perhaps
have
been
in
a
very
bad
way
the
jubilee
dinner
was
made
up
of
toasts
speeches
and
tears
in
short
zhmyhov
had
never
expected
that
his
merits
would
be
so
warmly
appreciated
gentlemen
he
said
before
the
dessert
two
hours
ago
i
was
recompensed
for
all
the
sufferings
a
man
has
to
undergo
who
is
the
servant
so
to
say
not
of
routine
not
of
the
letter
but
of
duty
through
the
whole
duration
of
my
service
i
have
constantly
adhered
to
the
principle
the
public
does
not
exist
for
us
but
we
for
the
public
and
to
day
i
received
the
highest
reward
my
subordinates
presented
me
with
an
album
see
i
was
touched
festive
faces
bent
over
the
album
and
began
examining
it
it
s
a
pretty
album
said
zhmyhov
s
daughter
olya
it
must
have
cost
fifty
roubles
i
do

olya

off
the
album
to
her
room
and
shut
it
up
in
her
table
drawer
next
day
she
took
the
clerks
out
of
it
flung
them
on
the
floor
and
put
her
school
friends
in
their
place
the
government
uniforms
made
way
for
white
pelerines
kolya
his
excellency
s
little
son
picked
up
the
clerks
and
painted
their
clothes
red
those
who
had
no
moustaches
he
presented
with
green
moustaches
and
added
brown
beards
to
the
beardless
when
there
was
nothing
left
to
paint
he
cut
the
little
men
out
of
the
card
board
pricked
their
eyes
with
a
pin
and
began
playing
soldiers
with
them
after
cutting
out
the
titular
councillor
kraterov
he
fixed
him
on
a
match
box
and
carried
him
in
that
state
to
his
father
s
study
papa
a
monument
look
zhmyhov
burst
out
laughing
lurched
forward
and
looking
tenderly
at
the
child
gave
him
a
warm
kiss
on
the
cheek
there

to

an
irresistible
impulse

in

absurd
and
what
do

podtyagin
considers
whether
to
take
offence
or
not
and
decides
to
take
offence
don

shout
here

is
not
a

travelled
abroad
all
over

place
and

asked
for
my
ticket
there
but
here

re
at

again
and
again
as
though

devil

so
much
it

not
enough
killing
the
passengers
with
fumes
and
stuffiness
and
draughts
they
want
to
strangle

with
red
tape
too
damn

cries
podtyagin
flaring
up
if
you
don
t
leave
off
shouting
and
disturbing
the
public
i
shall
be
obliged
to
put
you
out
at
the
next
station
and
to
draw
up
a
report
on
the
incident
this
is
revolting
exclaims
the
public
growing
indignant
persecuting
an
invalid
listen
and
have
some
consideration
but
the
gentleman
himself
was
abusive
says
podtyagin
a
little
scared
very
well
i
won
t
take
the
ticket
as
you
like
only
of
course
as
you
know
very
well
it
s
my
duty
to
do
so
if
it
were
not
my
duty
then
of
course
you
can
ask
the
station
master
ask
anyone
you
like
podtyagin
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
walks
away
from
the
invalid
at
first
he
feels
aggrieved
and
somewhat
injured
then
after
passing
through
two
or
three
carriages
he
begins
to
feel
a
certain
uneasiness
not
unlike
the
pricking
of
conscience
in
his
ticket
collector
s
bosom
there
certainly
was
no
need
to
wake
the
invalid
he
thinks
though
it
was
not
my
fault
they
imagine
i
did
it
wantonly
idly
they
don
t
know
that
i
m
bound
in
duty
if
they
don
t
believe
it
i
can
bring
the
station
master
to
them
a
station
the
train
stops
five
minutes
before
the
third
bell
podtyagin
enters
the
same
second
class
carriage
behind
him
stalks
the
station
master
in
a
red
cap
this
gentleman
here
podtyagin
begins
declares
that
i
have
no
right
to
ask
for
his
ticket
and
and
is
offended
at
it
i
ask
you
mr
station
master
to
explain
to
him

ask
for
tickets
according
to
regulation
or
to
please
myself

podtyagin
addresses
the
scraggy
looking
man
sir
you
can
ask
the
station
master
here
if
you
don
t
believe
me
the
invalid
starts
as
though
he
had
been
stung
opens
his
eyes
and
with
a
woebegone
face
sinks
back
in
his
seat
my
god
i
have
taken
another
powder
and
only
just
dozed
off
when
here
he
is
again
again

some
pity
on
me

the
station
master
whether

the
right

demand
your
ticket

the

and
pulling

podtyagin
shrugs
his

thinks

podtyagin
having

which

the

sighs
and
walks
out

he
goes
to
the
attendants
compartment
sits
down
at

exhausted
and
complains
oh

it

they
re

there

natalya
mihalovna
a
young
married
lady
who
had
arrived
in
the
morning
from
yalta
was
having
her
dinner
and
in
a
never
ceasing
flow
of
babble
was
telling
her
husband
of
all
the
charms
of
the
crimea
her
husband
delighted
gazed
tenderly
at
her
enthusiastic
face
listened
and
from
time
to
time
put
in
a
question
but
they
say
living
is
dreadfully
expensive
there
he
asked
among
other
things
well
what
shall
i
say
to
my
thinking
this
talk
of
its
being
so
expensive
is
exaggerated
hubby
the
devil
is
not
as
black
as
he
is
painted
yulia
petrovna
and
i
for
instance
had
very
decent
and
comfortable
rooms
for
twenty
roubles
a
day
everything
depends
on
knowing
how
to
do
things
my
dear
of
course
if
you
want
to
go
up
into
the
mountains
to
aie
petri
for
instance
if
you
take
a
horse
a
guide
then
of
course
it
does
come
to
something
it
s
awful
what
it
comes
to
but
vassitchka
the
mountains
there
imagine
high
high
mountains
a
thousand
times
higher
than
the
church
at
the
top
mist
mist
mist
at
the
bottom
enormous
stones
stones
stones
and
pines
ah
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
it
by
the
way
i
read
about
those
tatar
guides
there
in
some
magazine
while
you
were
away
such
abominable
stories
tell
me
is
there
really
anything
out
of
the
way
about
them
natalya
mihalovna
made
a
little
disdainful
grimace
and
shook
her
head
just
ordinary
tatars
nothing
special
she
said
though
indeed
i
only
had
a
glimpse
of
them
in
the
distance
they
were
pointed
out
to
me
but
i
did
not
take
much
notice
of
them
you
know
hubby
i
always
had
a
prejudice
against
all
such
circassians
greeks
moors
they
are
said
to
be
terrible
don
juans
perhaps
there
are
shameless
creatures
who
natalya
mihalovna
suddenly
jumped
up
from
her
chair
as
though
she
had
thought
of
something
dreadful
for
half
a
minute
she
looked
with
frightened
eyes
at
her
husband
and
said
accentuating
each
word
vassitchka
i
say
the
im
mo
ral
women
there
are
in
the
world
ah
how
immoral
and
it
s
not
as
though
they
were
working
class
or
middle
class
people
but
aristocratic
ladies
priding
themselves
on
their
bon
ton
it
was
simply
awful
i
could
not
believe
my
own
eyes
i
shall
remember
it
as
long
as
i
live
to
think
that
people
can
forget
themselves
to
such
a
point
as
ach
vassitchka
i
don
t
like
to
speak
of
it
take
my
companion
yulia
petrovna
for
example
such
a
good
husband
two
children
she
moves
in
a
decent
circle
always
poses
as
a
saint
and
all
at
once
would
you
believe
it
only
hubby
of
course
this
is
entre
nous
give
me
your
word
of
honour
you
won
t
tell
a
soul
what
next
of
course
i
won
t
tell
honour
bright
mind
now
i
trust
you
the
little
lady
put
down
her
fork
assumed
a
mysterious
air
and
whispered
imagine
a
thing
like
this
that
yulia
petrovna
rode
up
into
the
mountains
it
was
glorious
weather
she
rode
on
ahead
with
her
guide
i
was
a
little
behind
we
had
ridden
two
or
three
miles
all
at
once
only
fancy
vassitchka
yulia
cried
out
and
clutched
at
her
bosom
her
tatar
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
or
she
would
have
fallen
off
the
saddle
i
rode
up
to
her
with
my
guide
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
oh
she
cried
i
am
dying
i
feel
faint
i
can
t
go
any
further
fancy
my
alarm
let
us
go
back
then
i
said
no
natalie
she
said
i
can
t
go
back
i
shall
die
of
pain
if
i
move
another
step
i
have
spasms
and
she
prayed
and
besought
my
suleiman
and
me
to
ride
back
to
the
town
and
fetch
her
some
of
her
drops
which
always
do
her
good
stay
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
muttered
the
husband
scratching
his
forehead
you
said
just
now
that
you
had
only
seen
those
tatars
from
a
distance
and
now
you
are
talking
of
some
suleiman
there
you
are
finding
fault
again
the
lady
pouted
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
i
can
t
endure
suspiciousness
i
can
t
endure
it
it
s
stupid
stupid
i
am
not
finding
fault
but
why
say
what
is
not
true
if
you
rode
about
with
tatars
so
be
it
god
bless
you
but
why
shuffle
about
it
h
m
you
are
a
queer
one
cried
the
lady
revolted
he
is
jealous
of
suleiman
as
though
one
could
ride
up
into
the
mountains
without
a
guide
i
should
like
to
see
you
do
it
if
you
don
t
know
the
ways
there
if
you
don
t
understand
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
yes
hold
your
tongue
you
can
t
take
a
step
there
without
a
guide
so
it
seems
none
of
your
silly
grins
if
you
please
i
am
not
a
yulia
i
don
t
justify
her
but
i
though
i
don
t
pose
as
a
saint
i
don
t
forget
myself
to
that
degree
my
suleiman
never
overstepped
the
limits
no
o
mametkul
used
to
be
sitting
at
yulia
s
all
day
long
but
in
my
room
as
soon
as
it
struck
eleven
suleiman
march
off
you
go
and
my
foolish
tatar
boy
would
depart
i
made
him
mind
his
p
s
and
q
s
hubby
as
soon
as
he
began
grumbling
about
money
or
anything
i
would
say
how
wha
at
wha
a
a
t
and
his
heart
would
be
in
his
mouth
directly
ha
ha
ha
his
eyes
you
know
vassitchka
were
as
black
as
black
like
coals
such
an
amusing
little
tatar
face
so
funny
and
silly
i
kept
him
in
order
didn
t
i
just
i
can
fancy
mumbled
her
husband
rolling
up
pellets
of
bread
that
s
stupid
vassitchka
i
know
what
is
in
your
mind
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
but
i
assure
you
even
when
we
were
on
our
expeditions
i
never
let
him
overstep
the
limits
for
instance
if
we
rode
to
the
mountains
or
to
the
u
chan
su
waterfall
i
would
always
say
to
him
suleiman
ride
behind
do
you
hear
and
he
always
rode
behind
poor
boy
even
when
we
even
at
the
most
dramatic
moments
i
would
say
to
him
still
you
must
not
forget
that
you
are
only
a
tatar
and
i
am
the
wife
of
a
civil
councillor
ha
ha
the
little
lady
laughed
then
looking
round
her
quickly
and
assuming
an
alarmed
expression
whispered
but
yulia
oh
that
yulia
i
quite
see
vassitchka
there
is
no
reason
why
one
shouldn
t
have
a
little
fun
a
little
rest
from
the
emptiness
of
conventional
life
that
s
all
right
have
your
fling
by
all
means
no
one
will
blame
you
but
to
take
the
thing
seriously
to
get
up
scenes
no
say
what
you
like
i
can
not
understand
that
just
fancy
she
was
jealous
wasn
t
that
silly
one
day
mametkul
her
grande
passion
came
to
see
her
she
was
not
at
home
well
i
asked
him
into
my
room
there
was
conversation
one
thing
and
another
they
re
awfully
amusing
you
know
the
evening
passed
without
our
noticing
it
all
at
once
yulia
rushed
in
she
flew
at
me
and
at
mametkul
made
such
a
scene
fi
i
can
t
understand
that
sort
of
thing
vassitchka
vassitchka
cleared
his
throat
frowned
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
you
had
a
gay
time
there
i
must
say
he
growled
with
a
disdainful
smile
how
stu
upid
that
is
cried
natalya
mihalovna
offended
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
about
you
always
have
such
horrid
ideas
i
won
t
tell
you
anything
no
i
won
t
the
lady
pouted
and
said
no
more
overdoing
it
glyeb
gavrilovitch
smirnov
a
land
surveyor
arrived
at
the
station
of
gnilushki
he
had
another
twenty
or
thirty
miles
to
drive
before
he
would
reach
the
estate
which
he
had
been
summoned
to
survey
if
the
driver
were
not
drunk
and
the
horses
were
not
bad
it
would
hardly
be
twenty
miles
but
if
the
driver
had
had
a
drop
and
his
steeds
were
worn
out
it
would
mount
up
to
a
good
forty
tell
me
please
where
can
i
get
post
horses
here
the
surveyor
asked
of
the
station
gendarme
what
post
horses
there
s
no
finding
a
decent
dog
for
seventy
miles
round
let
alone
post
horses
but
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
dyevkino
general
hohotov
s
estate
well
yawned
the
gendarme
go
outside
the
station
there
are
sometimes
peasants
in
the
yard
there
they
will
take
passengers
the
surveyor
heaved
a
sigh
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
station
there
after
prolonged
enquiries
conversations
and
hesitations
he
found
a
very
sturdy
sullen
looking
pock
marked
peasant
wearing
a
tattered
grey
smock
and
bark
shoes
you
have
got
a
queer
sort
of
cart
said
the
surveyor
frowning
as
he
clambered
into
the
cart
there
is
no
making
out
which
is
the
back
and
which
is
the
front
what
is
there
to
make
out
where
the
horse
s
tail
is
there
s
the
front
and
where
your
honour
s
sitting
there
s
the
back
the
little
mare
was
young
but
thin
with
legs
planted
wide
apart
and
frayed
ears
when
the
driver
stood
up
and
lashed
her
with
a
whip
made
of
cord
she
merely
shook
her
head
when
he
swore
at
her
and
lashed
her
once
more
the
cart
squeaked
and
shivered
as
though
in
a
fever
after
the
third
lash
the
cart
gave
a
lurch
after
the
fourth
it
moved
forward
are
we
going
to
drive
like
this
all
the
way
asked
the
surveyor
violently
jolted
and
marvelling
at
the
capacity
of
russian
drivers
for
combining
a
slow
tortoise
like
pace
with
a
jolting
that
turns
the
soul
inside
out
we
shall
ge
et
there
the
peasant
reassured
him
the
mare
is
young
and
frisky
only
let
her
get
running
and
then
there
is
no
stopping
her
no
ow
cur
sed
brute
it
was
dusk
by
the
time
the
cart
drove
out
of
the
station
on
the
surveyor
s
right
hand
stretched
a
dark
frozen
plain
endless
and
boundless
if
you
drove
over
it
you
would
certainly
get
to
the
other
side
of
beyond
on
the
horizon
where
it
vanished
and
melted
into
the
sky
there
was
the
languid
glow
of
a
cold
autumn
sunset
on
the
left
of
the
road
mounds
of
some
sort
that
might
be
last
year
s
stacks
or
might
be
a
village
rose
up
in
the
gathering
darkness
the
surveyor
could
not
see
what
was
in
front
as
his
whole
field
of
vision
on
that
side
was
covered
by
the
broad
clumsy
back
of
the
driver
the
air
was
still
but
it
was
cold
and
frosty
what
a
wilderness
it
is
here
thought
the
surveyor
trying
to
cover
his
ears
with
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
neither
post
nor
paddock
if
by
ill
luck
one
were
attacked
and
robbed
no
one
would
hear
you
whatever
uproar
you
made
and
the
driver
is
not
one
you
could
depend
on
ugh
what
a
huge
back
a
child
of
nature
like
that
has
only
to
move
a
finger
and
it
would
be
all
up
with
one
and
his
ugly
face
is
suspicious
and
brutal
looking
hey
my
good
man
said
the
surveyor
what
is
your
name
mine
klim
well
klim
what
is
it
like
in
your
parts
here
not
dangerous
any
robbers
on
the
road
it
is
all
right
the
lord
has
spared
us
who
should
go
robbing
on
the
road
it
s
a
good
thing
there
are
no
robbers
but
to
be
ready
for
anything
i
have
got
three
revolvers
with
me
said
the
surveyor
untruthfully
and
it
doesn
t
do
to
trifle
with
a
revolver
you
know
one
can
manage
a
dozen
robbers
it
had
become
quite
dark
the
cart
suddenly
began
creaking
squeaking
shaking
and
as
though
unwillingly
turned
sharply
to
the
left
where
is
he
taking
me
to
the
surveyor
wondered
he
has
been
driving
straight
and
now
all
at
once
to
the
left
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
ll
take
me
the
rascal
to
some
den
of
thieves
and
things
like
that
do
happen
i
say
he
said
addressing
the
driver
so
you
tell
me
it
s
not
dangerous
here
that
s
a
pity
i
like
a
fight
with
robbers
i
am
thin
and
sickly
looking
but
i
have
the
strength
of
a
bull
once
three
robbers
attacked
me
and
what
do
you
think
i
gave
one
such
a
dressing
that
that
he
gave
up
his
soul
to
god
you
understand
and
the
other
two
were
sent
to
penal
servitude
in
siberia
and
where
i
got
the
strength
i
can
t
say
one
grips
a
strapping
fellow
of
your
sort
with
one
hand
and
wipes
him
out
klim
looked
round
at
the
surveyor
wrinkled
up
his
whole
face
and
lashed
his
horse
yes
the
surveyor
went
on
god
forbid
anyone
should
tackle
me
the
robber
would
have
his
bones
broken
and
what
s
more
he
would
have
to
answer
for
it
in
the
police
court
too
i
know
all
the
judges
and
the
police
captains
i
am
a
man
in
the
government
a
man
of
importance
here
i
am
travelling
and
the
authorities
know
they
keep
a
regular
watch
over
me
to
see
no
one
does
me
a
mischief
there
are
policemen
and
village
constables
stuck
behind
bushes
all
along
the
road
sto
sto
stop
the
surveyor
bawled
suddenly
where
have
you
got
to
where
are
you
taking
me
to
why
don
t
you
see
it
s
a
forest
it
certainly
is
a
forest
thought
the
surveyor
i
was
frightened
but
it
won
t
do
to
betray
my
feelings
he
has
noticed
already
that
i
am
in
a
funk
why
is
it
he
has
taken
to
looking
round
at
me
so
often
he
is
plotting
something
for
certain
at
first
he
drove
like
a
snail
and
now
how
he
is
dashing
along
i
say
klim
why
are
you
making
the
horse
go
like
that
i
am
not
making
her
go
she
is
racing
along
of
herself
once
she
gets
into
a
run
there
is
no
means
of
stopping
her
it
s
no
pleasure
to
her
that
her
legs
are
like
that
you
are
lying
my
man
i
see
that
you
are
lying
only
i
advise
you
not
to
drive
so
fast
hold
your
horse
in
a
bit
do
you
hear
hold
her
in
what
for
why
why
because
four
comrades
were
to
drive
after
me
from
the
station
we
must
let
them
catch
us
up
they
promised
to
overtake
us
in
this
forest
it
will
be
more
cheerful
in
their
company
they
are
a
strong
sturdy
set
of
fellows
and
each
of
them
has
got
a
pistol
why
do
you
keep
looking
round
and
fidgeting
as
though
you
were
sitting
on
thorns
eh
i
my
good
fellow
er
my
good
fellow
there
is
no
need
to
look
around
at
me
there
is
nothing
interesting
about
me
except
perhaps
the
revolvers
well
if
you
like
i
will
take
them
out
and
show
you
the
surveyor
made
a
pretence
of
feeling
in
his
pockets
and
at
that
moment
something
happened
which
he
could
not
have
expected
with
all
his
cowardice
klim
suddenly
rolled
off
the
cart
and
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
go
into
the
forest
help
he
roared
help
take
the
horse
and
the
cart
you
devil
only
don
t
take
my
life
help
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
hurriedly
retreating
of
twigs
snapping
and
all
was
still
the
surveyor
had
not
expected
such
a
d
nouement
he
first
stopped
the
horse
and
then
settled
himself
more
comfortably
in
the
cart
and
fell
to
thinking
he
has
run
off
he
was
scared
the
fool
well
what
s
to
be
done
now
i
can
t
go
on
alone
because
i
don
t
know
the
way
besides
they
may
think
i
have
stolen
his
horse
what
s
to
be
done
klim
klim
he
cried
klim
answered
the
echo
at
the
thought
that
he
would
have
to
sit
through
the
whole
night
in
the
cold
and
dark
forest
and
hear
nothing
but
the
wolves
the
echo
and
the
snorting
of
the
scraggy
mare
the
surveyor
began
to
have
twinges
down
his
spine
as
though
it
were
being
rasped
with
a
cold
file
klimushka
he
shouted
dear
fellow
where
are
you
klimushka
for
two
hours
the
surveyor
shouted
and
it
was
only
after
he
was
quite
husky
and
had
resigned
himself
to
spending
the
night
in
the
forest
that
a
faint
breeze
wafted
the
sound
of
a
moan
to
him
klim
is
it
you
dear
fellow
let
us
go
on
you
ll
mu
ur
der
me
but
i
was
joking
my
dear
man
i
swear
to
god
i
was
joking
as
though
i
had
revolvers
i
told
a
lie
because
i
was
frightened
for
goodness
sake
let
us
go
on
i
am
freezing
klim
probably
reflecting
that
a
real
robber
would
have
vanished
long
ago
with
the
horse
and
cart
came
out
of
the
forest
and
went
hesitatingly
up
to
his
passenger
well
what
were
you
frightened
of
stupid
i
i
was
joking
and
you
were
frightened
get
in
god
be
with
you
sir
klim
muttered
as
he
clambered
into
the
cart
if
i
had
known
i
wouldn
t
have
taken
you
for
a
hundred
roubles
i
almost
died
of
fright
klim
lashed
at
the
little
mare
the
cart
swayed
klim
lashed
once
more
and
the
cart
gave
a
lurch
after
the
fourth
stroke
of
the
whip
when
the
cart
moved
forward
the
surveyor
hid
his
ears
in
his
collar
and
sank
into
thought
the
road
and
klim
no
longer
seemed
dangerous
to
him
the
orator
one
fine
morning
the
collegiate
assessor
kirill
ivanovitch
babilonov
who
had
died
of
the
two
afflictions
so
widely
spread
in
our
country
a
bad
wife
and
alcoholism
was
being
buried
as
the
funeral
procession
set
off
from
the
church
to
the
cemetery
one
of
the
deceased
s
colleagues
called
poplavsky
got
into
a
cab
and
galloped
off
to
find
a
friend
one
grigory
petrovitch
zapoikin
a
man
who
though
still
young
had
acquired
considerable
popularity
zapoikin
as
many
of
my
readers
are
aware
possesses
a
rare
talent
for
impromptu
speechifying
at
weddings
jubilees
and
funerals
he
can
speak
whenever
he
likes
in
his
sleep
on
an
empty
stomach
dead
drunk
or
in
a
high
fever
his
words
flow
smoothly
and
evenly
like
water
out
of
a
pipe
and
in
abundance
there
are
far
more
moving
words
in
his
oratorical
dictionary
than
there
are
beetles
in
any
restaurant
he
always
speaks
eloquently
and
at
great
length
so
much
so
that
on
some
occasions
particularly
at
merchants
weddings
they
have
to
resort
to
assistance
from
the
police
to
stop
him
i
have
come
for
you
old
man
began
poplavsky
finding
him
at
home
put
on
your
hat
and
coat
this
minute
and
come
along
one
of
our
fellows
is
dead
we
are
just
sending
him
off
to
the
other
world
so
you
must
do
a
bit
of
palavering
by
way
of
farewell
to
him
you
are
our
only
hope
if
it
had
been
one
of
the
smaller
fry
it
would
not
have
been
worth
troubling
you
but
you
see
it
s
the
secretary
a
pillar
of
the
office
in
a
sense
it
s
awkward
for
such
a
whopper
to
be
buried
without
a
speech
oh
the
secretary
yawned
zapoikin
you
mean
the
drunken
one
yes
there
will
be
pancakes
a
lunch
you
ll
get
your
cab
fare
come
along
dear
chap
you
spout
out
some
rigmarole
like
a
regular
cicero
at
the
grave
and
what
gratitude
you
will
earn
zapoikin
readily
agreed
he
ruffled
up
his
hair
cast
a
shade
of
melancholy
over
his
face
and
went
out
into
the
street
with
poplavsky
i
know
your
secretary
he
said
as
he
got
into
the
cab
a
cunning
rogue
and
a
beast
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his
such
as
you
don
t
often
come
across
come
grisha
it
is
not
the
thing
to
abuse
the
dead
of
course
not
aut
mortuis
nihil
bene
but
still
he
was
a
rascal
the
friends
overtook
the
funeral
procession
and
joined
it
the
coffin
was
borne
along
slowly
so
that
before
they
reached
the
cemetery
they
were
able
three
times
to
drop
into
a
tavern
and
imbibe
a
little
to
the
health
of
the
departed
in
the
cemetery
came
the
service
by
the
graveside
the
mother
in
law
the
wife
and
the
sister
in
law
in
obedience
to
custom
shed
many
tears
when
the
coffin
was
being
lowered
into
the
grave
the
wife
even
shrieked
let
me
go
with
him
but
did
not
follow
her
husband
into
the
grave
probably
recollecting
her
pension
waiting
till
everything
was
quiet
again
zapoikin
stepped
forward
turned
his
eyes
on
all
present
and
began
can
i
believe
my
eyes
and
ears
is
it
not
a
terrible
dream
this
grave
these
tear
stained
faces
these
moans
and
lamentations
alas
it
is
not
a
dream
and
our
eyes
do
not
deceive
us
he
whom
we
have
only
so
lately
seen
so
full
of
courage
so
youthfully
fresh
and
pure
who
so
lately
before
our
eyes
like
an
unwearying
bee
bore
his
honey
to
the
common
hive
of
the
welfare
of
the
state
he
who
he
is
turned
now
to
dust
to
inanimate
mirage
inexorable
death
has
laid
his
bony
hand
upon
him
at
the
time
when
in
spite
of
his
bowed
age
he
was
still
full
of
the
bloom
of
strength
and
radiant
hopes
an
irremediable
loss
who
will
fill
his
place
for
us
good
government
servants
we
have
many
but
prokofy
osipitch
was
unique
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
was
devoted
to
his
honest
duty
he
did
not
spare
his
strength
but
worked
late
at
night
and
was
disinterested
impervious
to
bribes
how
he
despised
those
who
to
the
detriment
of
the
public
interest
sought
to
corrupt
him
who
by
the
seductive
goods
of
this
life
strove
to
draw
him
to
betray
his
duty
yes
before
our
eyes
prokofy
osipitch
would
divide
his
small
salary
between
his
poorer
colleagues
and
you
have
just
heard
yourselves
the
lamentations
of
the
widows
and
orphans
who
lived
upon
his
alms
devoted
to
good
works
and
his
official
duty
he
gave
up
the
joys
of
this
life
and
even
renounced
the
happiness
of
domestic
existence
as
you
are
aware
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
was
a
bachelor
and
who
will
replace
him
as
a
comrade
i
can
see
now
the
kindly
shaven
face
turned
to
us
with
a
gentle
smile
i
can
hear
now
his
soft
friendly
voice
peace
to
thine
ashes
prokofy
osipitch
rest
honest
noble
toiler
zapoikin
continued
while
his
listeners
began
whispering
together
his
speech
pleased
everyone
and
drew
some
tears
but
a
good
many
things
in
it
seemed
strange
in
the
first
place
they
could
not
make
out
why
the
orator
called
the
deceased
prokofy
osipitch
when
his
name
was
kirill
ivanovitch
in
the
second
everyone
knew
that
the
deceased
had
spent
his
whole
life
quarelling
with
his
lawful
wife
and
so
consequently
could
not
be
called
a
bachelor
in
the
third
he
had
a
thick
red
beard
and
had
never
been
known
to
shave
and
so
no
one
could
understand
why
the
orator
spoke
of
his
shaven
face
the
listeners
were
perplexed
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
prokofy
osipitch
continued
the
orator
looking
with
an
air
of
inspiration
into
the
grave
your
face
was
plain
even
hideous
you
were
morose
and
austere
but
we
all
know
that
under
that
outer
husk
there
beat
an
honest
friendly
heart
soon
the
listeners
began
to
observe
something
strange
in
the
orator
himself
he
gazed
at
one
point
shifted
about
uneasily
and
began
to
shrug
his
shoulders
too
all
at
once
he
ceased
speaking
and
gaping
with
astonishment
turned
to
poplavsky
i
say
he
s
alive
he
said
staring
with
horror
who
s
alive
why
prokofy
osipitch
there
he
stands
by
that
tombstone
he
never
died
it
s
kirill
ivanovitch
who
s
dead
but
you
told
me
yourself
your
secretary
was
dead
kirill
ivanovitch
was
our
secretary
you
ve
muddled
it
you
queer
fish
prokofy
osipitch
was
our
secretary
before
that
s
true
but
two
years
ago
he
was
transferred
to
the
second
division
as
head
clerk
how
the
devil
is
one
to
tell
why
are
you
stopping
go
on
it
s
awkward
zapoikin
turned
to
the
grave
and
with
the
same
eloquence
continued
his
interrupted
speech
prokofy
osipitch
an
old
clerk
with
a
clean
shaven
face
was
in
fact
standing
by
a
tombstone
he
looked
at
the
orator
and
frowned
angrily
well
you
have
put
your
foot
into
it
haven
t
you
laughed
his
fellow
clerks
as
they
returned
from
the
funeral
with
zapoikin
burying
a
man
alive
it
s
unpleasant
young
man
grumbled
prokofy
osipitch
your
speech
may
be
all
right
for
a
dead
man
but
in
reference
to
a
living
one
it
is
nothing
but
sarcasm
upon
my
soul
what
have
you
been
saying
disinterested
incorruptible
won
t
take
bribes
such
things
can
only
be
said
of
the
living
in
sarcasm
and
no
one
asked
you
sir
to
expatiate
on
my
face
plain
hideous
so
be
it
but
why
exhibit
my
countenance
in
that
public
way
it
s
insulting
malingerers

walks
into

puts
down

in

up
to
the

and
without
a
word
drops
on
one
knee
before
her
what
are

about
kuzma

cries
the
lady
in
horror
flushing
crimson
for
goodness

while
i

i
will
not
rise
says
zamuhrishen
bending
over
her

see
my
homage
on
my
knees
our
guardian
angel
benefactress
of
the
human
race
let
them
before
the
good
fairy
who
has
given
me
life
guided
me
into
the
path
of
truth
and
enlightened
my
scepticism
i
am
ready
not
merely
to
kneel
but
to
pass
through
fire
our
miraculous
healer
mother
of
the
orphan
and
the
widowed
i
have

i
am
a
new

i
i
am
very
glad
mutters
the
lady
flushing
with
pleasure
it
s
so
pleasant
to
hear
that
sit
down
please
why
you
were
so
seriously
ill
that
tuesday
yes
indeed
how
ill
i
was
it
s
awful
to
recall
it
says
zamuhrishen
taking
a
seat
i
had
rheumatism
in
every
part
and
every
organ
i
have
been
in
misery
for
eight
years
i
ve
had
no
rest
from
it
by
day
or
by
night
my
benefactress
i
have
consulted
doctors
and
i
went
to
professors
at
kazan
i
have
tried
all
sorts
of
mud
baths
and
drunk
waters
and
goodness
knows
what
i
haven
t
tried
i
have
wasted
all
my
substance
on
doctors
my
beautiful
lady
the
doctors
did
me
nothing
but
harm
they
drove
the
disease
inwards
drive
in
that
they
did
but
to
drive
out
was
beyond
their
science
all
they
care
about
is
their
fees
the
brigands
but
as
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
for
that
they
don
t
care
a
straw
they
prescribe
some
quackery
and
you
have
to
drink
it
assassins
that
s
the
only
word
for
them
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
our
angel
i
should
have
been
in
the
grave
by
now
i
went
home
from
you
that
tuesday
looked
at
the
pilules
that
you
gave
me
then
and
wondered
what
good
there
could
be
in
them
was
it
possible
that
those
little
grains
scarcely
visible
could
cure
my
immense
long
standing
disease
that
s
what
i
thought
unbeliever
that
i
was
and
i
smiled
but
when
i
took
the
pilule
it
was
instantaneous
it
was
as
though
i
had
not
been
ill
or
as
though
it
had
been
lifted
off
me
my
wife
looked
at
me
with
her
eyes
starting
out
of
her
head

to
praying

that

are

wipes
his
eyes
with
his
sleeve
gets
up
from
his
chair
and
shows
a
disposition
to
drop
on
one
knee
again
but
the
lady
checks
him
and
makes
him
sit
down
it
s
not
me

must
thank
she
says
blushing
with
excitement
and
looking
enthusiastically
at
the
portrait
of
father
aristark
it
s
not
my
doing
i
am
only
the
obedient
instrument

by
one
pilule

were
so
kind
as
to
give
me

pilules

i
took
at
dinner
and
the
effect
was
instantaneous
another
in
the
evening
and
the
third
next
day
and
since
then
not
a
touch
not
a
twinge
anywhere

had
written
to

my
son

lord

given

lady

was
hobbling
and
now
i
am
ready
to
run
after
a
hare
i
could
live
for
a
hundred
years
there
s
only
one
trouble
our
lack
of
means
i
m
well
now
but
what
s
the
use
of
health
if
there
s
nothing
to
live
on
poverty
weighs
on
me
worse
than
illness
for
example
take
this
it
s
the
time
to
sow
oats
and
how
is
one
to
sow
it
if
one
has
no
seed

so
delighted

you
have
given
me
so
much
pleasure
that

not
you
but
i
that
should
say
thank
you
you
are
our
joy
that
the
lord
should
create
such
goodness
rejoice
madam
looking
at
your
good
deeds
while
we
sinners
have
no
cause
for
rejoicing
in
ourselves
we
are
paltry
poor
spirited
useless
people
a
mean
lot
we
are
only
gentry
in
name
but
in
a
material
sense
we
are
the
same
as
peasants
only
worse
we
live
in
stone
houses
but
it
s
a
mere
make
believe
for
the
roof
leaks
and
there
is
no
money
to
buy
wood
to
mend
it
with
i
ll
give
you

asks
for

gets
a
cow
too
a
letter
of
recommendation
for
his
daughter
whom
he
wants
to
send
to
a
boarding
school
and
touched
by
the
lady
s
liberality
he
whimpers
with
excess
of
feeling
twists
his
mouth
and
feels
in
his
pocket
for
his
handkerchief
marfa
petrovna
sees
a
red
paper
slip
out
of
his
pocket
with
his
handkerchief
and
fall
noiselessly
to
the
floor
i
shall
never
forget
it
to
all
eternity
he
mutters
and
i
shall
make
my
children
and
my
grandchildren
remember
it
from
generation
to
generation
see
children
i
shall
say
who
has
saved
me
from
the
grave
who
when
she
has
seen
her
patient
out
the
lady
looks
for
a
minute
at
father
aristark
with
eyes
full
of
tears
then
turns
her
caressing
reverent
gaze
on
the
drug
chest
the
books
the
bills
the
armchair
in
which
the
man
she
had
saved
from
death
has
just
been
sitting
and
her
eyes
fall
on
the
paper
just
dropped
by
her
patient
she
picks
up
the
paper
unfolds
it
and
sees
in
it
three
pilules
the
very
pilules
she
had
given
zamuhrishen
the
previous
tuesday
they
are
the
very
ones
she
thinks
puzzled
the
paper
is
the
same
he
hasn
t
even
unwrapped
them
what
has
he
taken
then
strange
surely
he
wouldn
t
try
to
deceive
me
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
ten
years
of
practice
a
doubt
creeps
into
marfa
petrovna
s
mind
she
summons
the
other
patients
and
while
talking
to
them
of
their
complaints
notices
what
has
hitherto
slipped
by
her
ears
unnoticed
the
patients
every
one
of
them
as
though
they
were
in
a
conspiracy
first
belaud
her
for
their
miraculous
cure
go
into
raptures
over
her
medical
skill
and
abuse
allopath
doctors
then
when
she
is
flushed
with
excitement
begin
holding
forth
on
their
needs
one
asks
for
a
bit
of
land
to
plough
another
for
wood
a
third
for
permission
to
shoot
in
her
forests
and
so
on
she
looks
at
the
broad
benevolent
countenance
of
father
aristark
who
has
revealed
the
truth
to
her
and
a
new
truth
begins
gnawing
at
her
heart
an
evil
oppressive
truth
the
deceitfulness
of
man
in
the
graveyard
the
wind
has
got
up
friends
and
it
is
beginning
to
get
dark
hadn
t
we
better
take
ourselves
off
before
it
gets
worse
the
wind
was
frolicking
among
the
yellow
leaves
of
the
old
birch
trees
and
a
shower
of
thick
drops
fell
upon
us
from
the
leaves
one
of
our
party
slipped
on
the
clayey
soil
and
clutched
at
a
big
grey
cross
to
save
himself
from
falling
yegor
gryaznorukov
titular
councillor
and
cavalier
he
read
i
knew
that
gentleman
he
was
fond
of
his
wife
he
wore
the
stanislav
ribbon
and
read
nothing
his
digestion
worked
well
life
was
all
right
wasn
t
it
one
would
have
thought
he
had
no
reason
to
die
but
alas
fate
had
its
eye
on
him
the
poor
fellow
fell
a
victim
to
his
habits
of
observation
on
one
occasion
when
he
was
listening
at
a
keyhole
he
got
such
a
bang
on
the
head
from
the
door
that
he
sustained
concussion
of
the
brain
he
had
a
brain
and
died
and
here
under
this
tombstone
lies
a
man
who
from
his
cradle
detested
verses
and
epigrams
as
though
to
mock
him
his
whole
tombstone
is
adorned
with
verses
there
is
someone
coming
a
man
in
a
shabby
overcoat
with
a
shaven
bluish
crimson
countenance
overtook
us
he
had
a
bottle
under
his
arm
and
a
parcel
of
sausage
was
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
where
is
the
grave
of
mushkin
the
actor
he
asked
us
in
a
husky
voice
we
conducted
him
towards
the
grave
of
mushkin
the
actor
who
had
died
two
years
before
you
are
a
government
clerk
i
suppose
we
asked
him
no
an
actor
nowadays
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
actors
from
clerks
of
the
consistory
no
doubt
you
have
noticed
that
that
s
typical
but
it
s
not
very
flattering
for
the
government
clerk
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
found
the
actor
s
grave
it
had
sunken
was
overgrown
with
weeds
and
had
lost
all
appearance
of
a
grave
a
cheap
little
cross
that
had
begun
to
rot
and
was
covered
with
green
moss
blackened
by
the
frost
had
an
air
of
aged
dejection
and
looked
as
it
were
ailing
forgotten
friend
mushkin
we
read
time
had
erased
the
never
and
corrected
the
falsehood
of
man
a
subscription
for
a
monument
to
him
was
got
up
among
actors
and
journalists
but
they
drank
up
the
money
the
dear
fellows
sighed
the
actor
bowing
down
to
the
ground
and
touching
the
wet
earth
with
his
knees
and
his
cap
how
do
you
mean
drank
it
that
s
very
simple
they
collected
the
money
published
a
paragraph
about
it
in
the
newspaper
and
spent
it
on
drink
i
don
t
say
it
to
blame
them
i
hope
it
did
them
good
dear
things
good
health
to
them
and
eternal
memory
to
him
drinking
means
bad
health
and
eternal
memory
nothing
but
sadness
god
give
us
remembrance
for
a
time
but
eternal
memory
what
next
you
are
right
there
mushkin
was
a
well
known
man
you
see
there
were
a
dozen
wreaths
on
the
coffin
and
he
is
already
forgotten
those
to
whom
he
was
dear
have
forgotten
him
but
those
to
whom
he
did
harm
remember
him
i
for
instance
shall
never
never
forget
him
for
i
got
nothing
but
harm
from
him
i
have
no
love
for
the
deceased
what
harm
did
he
do
you
great
harm
sighed
the
actor
and
an
expression
of
bitter
resentment
overspread
his
face
to
me
he
was
a
villain
and
a
scoundrel
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his
it
was
through
looking
at
him
and
listening
to
him
that
i
became
an
actor
by
his
art
he
lured
me
from
the
parental
home
he
enticed
me
with
the
excitements
of
an
actor
s
life
promised
me
all
sorts
of
things
and
brought
tears
and
sorrow
an
actor
s
lot
is
a
bitter
one
i
have
lost
youth
sobriety
and
the
divine
semblance
i
haven
t
a
half
penny
to
bless
myself
with
my
shoes
are
down
at
heel
my
breeches
are
frayed
and
patched
and
my
face
looks
as
if
it
had
been
gnawed
by
dogs
my
head
s
full
of
freethinking
and
nonsense
he
robbed
me
of
my
faith
my
evil
genius
it
would
have
been
something
if
i
had
had
talent
but
as
it
is
i
am
ruined
for
nothing
it
s
cold
honoured
friends
won
t
you
have
some
there
is
enough
for
all
b
r
r
r
let
us
drink
to
the
rest
of
his
soul
though
i
don
t
like
him
and
though
he
s
dead
he
was
the
only
one
i
had
in
the
world
the
only
one
it
s
the
last
time
i
shall
visit
him
the
doctors
say
i
shall
soon
die
of
drink
so
here
i
have
come
to
say
good
bye
one
must
forgive
one
s
enemies
we
left
the
actor
to
converse
with
the
dead
mushkin
and
went
on
it
began
drizzling
a
fine
cold
rain
at
the
turning
into
the
principal
avenue
strewn
with
gravel
we
met
a
funeral
procession
four
bearers
wearing
white
calico
sashes
and
muddy
high
boots
with
leaves
sticking
on
them
carried
the
brown
coffin
it
was
getting
dark
and
they
hastened
stumbling
and
shaking
their
burden
we
ve
only
been
walking
here
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
that
is
the
third
brought
in
already
shall
we
go
home
friends
hush
ivan
yegoritch
krasnyhin
a
fourth
rate
journalist
returns
home
late
at
night
grave
and
careworn
with
a
peculiar
air
of
concentration
he
looks
like
a
man
expecting
a
police
raid
or
contemplating
suicide
pacing
about
his
rooms
he
halts
abruptly
ruffles
up
his
hair
and
says
in
the
tone
in
which
laertes
announces
his
intention
of
avenging
his
sister
shattered
soul
weary
a
sick
load
of
misery
on
the
heart
and
then
to
sit
down
and
write
and
this
is
called
life
how
is
it
nobody
has
described
the
agonizing
discord
in
the
soul
of
a
writer
who
has
to
amuse
the
crowd
when
his
heart
is
heavy
or
to
shed
tears
at
the
word
of
command
when
his
heart
is
light
i
must
be
playful
coldly
unconcerned
witty
but
what
if
i
am
weighed
down
with
misery
what
if
i
am
ill
or
my
child
is
dying
or
my
wife
in
anguish
he
says
this
brandishing
his
fists
and
rolling
his
eyes
then
he
goes
into
the
bedroom
and
wakes
his
wife
nadya
he
says
i
am
sitting
down
to
write
please
don
t
let
anyone
interrupt
me
i
can
t
write
with
children
crying
or
cooks
snoring
see
too
that
there
s
tea
and
steak
or
something
you
know
that
i
can
t
write
without
tea
tea
is
the
one
thing
that
gives
me
the
energy
for
my
work
returning
to
his
room
he
takes
off
his
coat
waistcoat
and
boots
he
does
this
very
slowly
then
assuming
an
expression
of
injured
innocence
he
sits
down
to
his
table
there
is
nothing
casual
nothing
ordinary
on
his
writing
table
down
to
the
veriest
trifle
everything
bears
the
stamp
of
a
stern
deliberately
planned
programme
little
busts
and
photographs
of
distinguished
writers
heaps
of
rough
manuscripts
a
volume
of
byelinsky
with
a
page
turned
down
part
of
a
skull
by
way
of
an
ash
tray
a
sheet
of
newspaper
folded
carelessly
but
so
that
a
passage
is
uppermost
boldly
marked
in
blue
pencil
with
the
word
disgraceful
there
are
a
dozen
sharply
pointed
pencils
and
several
penholders
fitted
with
new
nibs
put
in
readiness
that
no
accidental
breaking
of
a
pen
may
for
a
single
second
interrupt
the
flight
of
his
creative
fancy
ivan
yegoritch
throws
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
closing
his
eyes
concentrates
himself
on
his
subject
he
hears
his
wife
shuffling
about
in
her
slippers
and
splitting
shavings
to
heat
the
samovar
she
is
hardly
awake
that
is
apparent
from
the
way
the
knife
and
the
lid
of
the
samovar
keep
dropping
from
her
hands
soon
the
hissing
of
the
samovar
and
the
spluttering
of
the
frying
meat
reaches
him
his
wife
is
still
splitting
shavings
and
rattling
with
the
doors
and
blowers
of
the
stove
all
at
once
ivan
yegoritch
starts
opens
frightened
eyes
and
begins
to
sniff
the
air
heavens
the
stove
is
smoking
he
groans
grimacing
with
a
face
of
agony
smoking
that
insufferable
woman
makes
a
point
of
trying
to
poison
me
how
in
god
s
name
am
i
to
write
in
such
surroundings
kindly
tell
me
that
he
rushes
into
the
kitchen
and
breaks
into
a
theatrical
wail
when
a
little
later
his
wife
stepping
cautiously
on
tiptoe
brings
him
in
a
glass
of
tea
he
is
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
as
before
with
his
eyes
closed
absorbed
in
his
article
he
does
not
stir
drums
lightly
on
his
forehead
with
two
fingers
and
pretends
he
is
not
aware
of
his
wife
s
presence
his
face
wears
an
expression
of
injured
innocence
like
a
girl
who
has
been
presented
with
a
costly
fan
he
spends
a
long
time
coquetting
grimacing
and
posing
to
himself
before
he
writes
the
title
he
presses
his
temples
he
wriggles
and
draws
his
legs
up
under
his
chair
as
though
he
were
in
pain
or
half
closes
his
eyes
languidly
like
a
cat
on
the
sofa
at
last
not
without
hesitation
he
stretches
out
his
hand
towards
the
inkstand
and
with
an
expression
as
though
he
were
signing
a
death
warrant
writes
the
title
mammy
give
me
some
water
he
hears
his
son
s
voice
hush
says
his
mother
daddy
s
writing
hush
daddy
writes
very
very
quickly
without
corrections
or
pauses
he
has
scarcely
time
to
turn
over
the
pages
the
busts
and
portraits
of
celebrated
authors
look
at
his
swiftly
racing
pen
and
keeping
stock
still
seem
to
be
thinking
oh
my
how
you
are
going
it
sh
squeaks
the
pen
sh
whisper
the
authors
when
his
knee
jolts
the
table
and
they
are
set
trembling
all
at
once
krasnyhin
draws
himself
up
lays
down
his
pen
and
listens
he
hears
an
even
monotonous
whispering
it
is
foma
nikolaevitch
the
lodger
in
the
next
room
saying
his
prayers
i
say
cries
krasnyhin
couldn
t
you
please
say
your
prayers
more
quietly
you
prevent
me
from
writing
very
sorry
foma
nikolaevitch
answers
timidly
after
covering
five
pages
krasnyhin
stretches
and
looks
at
his
watch
goodness
three
o
clock
already
he
moans
other
people
are
asleep
while
i
i
alone
must
work
shattered
and
exhausted
he
goes
with
his
head
on
one
side
to
the
bedroom
to
wake
his
wife
and
says
in
a
languid
voice
nadya
get
me
some
more
tea
i
feel
weak
he
writes
till
four
o
clock
and
would
readily
have
written
till
six
if
his
subject
had
not
been
exhausted
coquetting
and
posing
to
himself
and
the
inanimate
objects
about
him
far
from
any
indiscreet
critical
eye
tyrannizing
and
domineering
over
the
little
anthill
that
fate
has
put
in
his
power
are
the
honey
and
the
salt
of
his
existence
and
how
different
is
this
despot
here
at
home
from
the
humble
meek
dull
witted
little
man
we
are
accustomed
to
see
in
the
editor
s
offices
i
am
so
exhausted
that
i
am
afraid
i
shan
t
sleep
he
says
as
he
gets
into
bed
our
work
this
cursed
ungrateful
hard
labour
exhausts
the
soul
even
more
than
the
body
i
had
better
take
some
bromide
god
knows
if
it
were
not
for
my
family
i
d
throw
up
the
work
to
write
to
order
it
is
awful
he
sleeps
till
twelve
or
one
o
clock
in
the
day
sleeps
a
sound
healthy
sleep
ah
how
he
would
sleep
what
dreams
he
would
have
how
he
would
spread
himself
if
he
were
to
become
a
well
known
writer
an
editor
or
even
a
sub
editor
he
has
been
writing
all
night
whispers
his
wife
with
a
scared
expression
on
her
face
sh
no
one
dares
to
speak
or
move
or
make
a
sound
his
sleep
is
something
sacred
and
the
culprit
who
offends
against
it
will
pay
dearly
for
his
fault
hush
floats
over
the
flat
hush
in
an
hotel
let
me
tell
you
my
good
man
began
madame
nashatyrin
the
colonel
s
lady
at
no
47
crimson
and
spluttering
as
she
pounced
on
the
hotel
keeper
either
give
me
other
apartments
or
i
shall
leave
your
confounded
hotel
altogether
it
s
a
sink
of
iniquity
mercy
on
us
i
have
grown
up
daughters
and
one
hears
nothing
but
abominations
day
and
night
it
s
beyond
everything
day
and
night
sometimes
he
fires
off
such
things
that
it
simply
makes
one
s
ears
blush
positively
like
a
cabman
it
s
a
good
thing
that
my
poor
girls
don
t
understand
or
i
should
have
to
fly
out
into
the
street
with
them
he
s
saying
something
now
you
listen
i
know
a
thing
better
than
that
my
boy
a
husky
bass
floated
in
from
the
next
room
do
you
remember
lieutenant
druzhkov
well
that
same
druzhkov
was
one
day
making
a
drive
with
the
yellow
into
the
pocket
and
as
he
usually
did
you
know
flung
up
his
leg
all
at
once
something
went
crrr
ack
at
first
they
thought
he
had
torn
the
cloth
of
the
billiard
table
but
when
they
looked
my
dear
fellow
his
united
states
had
split
at
every
seam
he
had
made
such
a
high
kick
the
beast
that
not
a
seam
was
left
ha
ha
ha
and
there
were
ladies
present
too
among
others
the
wife
of
that
drivelling
lieutenant
okurin
okurin
was
furious
how
dare
the
fellow
said
he
behave
with
impropriety
in
the
presence
of
my
wife
one
thing
led
to
another
you
know
our
fellows
okurin
sent
seconds
to
druzhkov
and
druzhkov
said
don
t
be
a
fool
ha
ha
ha
but
tell
him
he
had
better
send
seconds
not
to
me
but
to
the
tailor
who
made
me
those
breeches
it
is
his
fault
you
know
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
lilya
and
mila
the
colonel
s
daughters
who
were
sitting
in
the
window
with
their
round
cheeks
propped
on
their
fists
flushed
crimson
and
dropped
their
eyes
that
looked
buried
in
their
plump
faces
now
you
have
heard
him
haven
t
you
madame
nashatyrin
went
on
addressing
the
hotel
keeper
and
that
you
consider
of
no
consequence
i
suppose
i
am
the
wife
of
a
colonel
sir
my
husband
is
a
commanding
officer
i
will
not
permit
some
cabman
to
utter
such
infamies
almost
in
my
presence
he
is
not
a
cabman
madam
but
the
staff
captain
kikin
a
gentleman
born
if
he
has
so
far
forgotten
his
station
as
to
express
himself
like
a
cabman
then
he
is
even
more
deserving
of
contempt
in
short
don
t
answer
me
but
kindly
take
steps
but
what
can
i
do
madam
you
are
not
the
only
one
to
complain
everybody
s
complaining
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
him
one
goes
to
his
room
and
begins
putting
him
to
shame
saying
hannibal
ivanitch
have
some
fear
of
god
it
s
shameful
and
he
ll
punch
you
in
the
face
with
his
fists
and
say
all
sorts
of
things
there
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
and
such
like
it
s
a
disgrace
he
wakes
up
in
the
morning
and
sets
to
walking
about
the
corridor
in
nothing
saving
your
presence
but
his
underclothes
and
when
he
has
had
a
drop
he
will
pick
up
a
revolver
and
set
to
putting
bullets
into
the
wall
by
day
he
is
swilling
liquor
and
at
night
he
plays
cards
like
mad
and
after
cards
it
is
fighting
i
am
ashamed
for
the
other
lodgers
to
see
it
why
don
t
you
get
rid
of
the
scoundrel
why
there
s
no
getting
him
out
he
owes
me
for
three
months
but
we
don
t
ask
for
our
money
we
simply
ask
him
to
get
out
as
a
favour
the
magistrate
has
given
him
an
order
to
clear
out
of
the
rooms
but
he
s
taking
it
from
one
court
to
another
and
so
it
drags
on
he
s
a
perfect
nuisance
that
s
what
he
is
and
good
lord
such
a
man
too
young
good
looking
and
intellectual
when
he
hasn
t
had
a
drop
you
couldn
t
wish
to
see
a
nicer
gentleman
the
other
day
he
wasn
t
drunk
and
he
spent
the
whole
day
writing
letters
to
his
father
and
mother
poor
father
and
mother
sighed
the
colonel
s
lady
they
are
to
be
pitied
to
be
sure
there
s
no
comfort
in
having
such
a
scamp
he
s
sworn
at
and
turned
out
of
his
lodgings
and
not
a
day
passes
but
he
is
in
trouble
over
some
scandal
it
s
sad
his
poor
unhappy
wife
sighed
the
lady
he
has
no
wife
madam
a
likely
idea
she
would
have
to
thank
god
if
her
head
were
not
broken
the
lady
walked
up
and
down
the
room
he
is
not
married
you
say
certainly
not
madam
the
lady
walked
up
and
down
the
room
again
and
mused
a
little
h
m
not
married
she
pronounced
meditatively
h
m
lilya
and
mila
don
t
sit
at
the
window
there
s
a
draught
what
a
pity
a
young
man
and
to
let
himself
sink
to
this
and
all
owing
to
what
the
lack
of
good
influence
there
is
no
mother
who
would
not
married
well
there
it
is
please
be
so
good
the
lady
continued
suavely
after
a
moment
s
thought
as
to
go
to
him
and
ask
him
in
my
name
to
refrain
from
using
expressions
tell
him
that
madame
nashatyrin
begs
him
tell
him
she
is
staying
with
her
daughters
in
no
47
that
she
has
come
up
from
her
estate
in
the
country
certainly
tell
him
a
colonel
s
lady
and
her
daughters
he
might
even
come
and
apologize
we
are
always
at
home
after
dinner
oh
mila
shut
the
window
why
what
do
you
want
with
that
black
sheep
mamma
drawled
lilya
when
the
hotel
keeper
had
retired
a
queer
person
to
invite
a
drunken
rowdy
rascal
oh
don
t
say
so
ma
ch
re
you
always
talk
like
that
and
there
sit
down
why
whatever
he
may
be
we
ought
not
to
despise
him
there
s
something
good
in
everyone
who
knows
sighed
the
colonel
s
lady
looking
her
daughters
up
and
down
anxiously
perhaps
your
fate
is
here
change
your
dresses
anyway
in
a
strange
land
sunday
midday
a
landowner
called
kamyshev
is
sitting
in
his
dining
room
deliberately
eating
his
lunch
at
a
luxuriously
furnished
table
monsieur
champoun
a
clean
neat
smoothly
shaven
old
frenchman
is
sharing
the
meal
with
him
this
champoun
had
once
been
a
tutor
in
kamyshev
s
household
had
taught
his
children
good
manners
the
correct
pronunciation
of
french
and
dancing
afterwards
when
kamyshev
s
children
had
grown
up
and
become
lieutenants
champoun
had
become
something
like
a
bonne
of
the
male
sex
the
duties
of
the
former
tutor
were
not
complicated
he
had
to
be
properly
dressed
to
smell
of
scent
to
listen
to
kamyshev
s
idle
babble
to
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
and
apparently
that
was
all
for
this
he
received
a
room
his
board
and
an
indefinite
salary
kamyshev
eats
and
as
usual
babbles
at
random
damnation
he
says
wiping
away
the
tears
that
have
come
into
his
eyes
after
a
mouthful
of
ham
thickly
smeared
with
mustard
ough
it
has
shot
into
my
head
and
all
my
joints
your
french
mustard
would
not
do
that
you
know
if
you
ate
the
whole
potful
some
like
the
french
some
prefer
the
russian
champoun
assents
mildly
no
one
likes
french
mustard
except
frenchmen
and
a
frenchman
will
eat
anything
whatever
you
give
him
frogs
and
rats
and
black
beetles
brrr
you
don
t
like
that
ham
for
instance
because
it
is
russian
but
if
one
were
to
give
you
a
bit
of
baked
glass
and
tell
you
it
was
french
you
would
eat
it
and
smack
your
lips
to
your
thinking
everything
russian
is
nasty
i
don
t
say
that
everything
russian
is
nasty
but
if
it
s
french
o
say
tray
zholee
to
your
thinking
there
is
no
country
better
than
france
but
to
my
mind
why
what
is
france
to
tell
the
truth
about
it
a
little
bit
of
land
our
police
captain
was
sent
out
there
but
in
a
month
he
asked
to
be
transferred
there
was
nowhere
to
turn
round
one
can
drive
round
the
whole
of
your
france
in
one
day
while
here
when
you
drive
out
of
the
gate
you
can
see
no
end
to
the
land
you
can
ride
on
and
on
yes
monsieur
russia
is
an
immense
country
to
be
sure
it
is
to
your
thinking
there
are
no
better
people
than
the
french
well
educated
clever
people
civilization
i
agree
the
french
are
all
well
educated
with
elegant
manners
that
is
true
a
frenchman
never
allows
himself
to
be
rude
he
hands
a
lady
a
chair
at
the
right
minute
he
doesn
t
eat
crayfish
with
his
fork
he
doesn
t
spit
on
the
floor
but
there
s
not
the
same
spirit
in
him
not
the
spirit
in
him
i
don
t
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
but
however
one
is
to
express
it
there
s
nothing
in
a
frenchman
of
something
the
speaker
flourishes
his
fingers
of
something
fanatical
i
remember
i
have
read
somewhere
that
all
of
you
have
intelligence
acquired
from
books
while
we
russians
have
innate
intelligence
if
a
russian
studies
the
sciences
properly
none
of
your
french
professors
is
a
match
for
him
perhaps
says
champoun
as
it
were
reluctantly
no
not
perhaps
but
certainly
it
s
no
use
your
frowning
it
s
the
truth
i
am
speaking
the
russian
intelligence
is
an
inventive
intelligence
only
of
course
he
is
not
given
a
free
outlet
for
it
and
he
is
no
hand
at
boasting
he
will
invent
something
and
break
it
or
give
it
to
the
children
to
play
with
while
your
frenchman
will
invent
some
nonsensical
thing
and
make
an
uproar
for
all
the
world
to
hear
it
the
other
day
iona
the
coachman
carved
a
little
man
out
of
wood
if
you
pull
the
little
man
by
a
thread
he
plays
unseemly
antics
but
iona
does
not
brag
of
it
i
don
t
like
frenchmen
as
a
rule
i
am
not
referring
to
you
but
speaking
generally
they
are
an
immoral
people
outwardly
they
look
like
men
but
they
live
like
dogs
take
marriage
for
instance
with
us
once
you
are
married
you
stick
to
your
wife
and
there
is
no
talk
about
it
but
goodness
knows
how
it
is
with
you
the
husband
is
sitting
all
day
long
in
a
caf
while
his
wife
fills
the
house
with
frenchmen
and
sets
to
dancing
the
can
can
with
them
that
s
not
true
champoun
protests
flaring
up
and
unable
to
restrain
himself
the
principle
of
the
family
is
highly
esteemed
in
france
we
know
all
about
that
principle
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
defend
it
one
ought
to
be
impartial
a
pig
is
always
a
pig
we
must
thank
the
germans
for
having
beaten
them
yes
indeed
god
bless
them
for
it
in
that
case
monsieur
i
don
t
understand
says
the
frenchman
leaping
up
with
flashing
eyes
if
you
hate
the
french
why
do
you
keep
me
what
am
i
to
do
with
you
let
me
go
and
i
will
go
back
to
france
wha
at
but
do
you
suppose
they
would
let
you
into
france
now
why
you
are
a
traitor
to
your
country
at
one
time
napoleon
s
your
great
man
at
another
gambetta
who
the
devil
can
make
you
out
monsieur
says
champoun
in
french
spluttering
and
crushing
up
his
table
napkin
in
his
hands
my
worst
enemy
could
not
have
thought
of
a
greater
insult
than
the
outrage
you
have
just
done
to
my
feelings
all
is
over
and
with
a
tragic
wave
of
his
arm
the
frenchman
flings
his
dinner
napkin
on
the
table
majestically
and
walks
out
of
the
room
with
dignity
three
hours
later
the
table
is
laid
again
and
the
servants
bring
in
the
dinner
kamyshev
sits
alone
at
the
table
after
the
preliminary
glass
he
feels
a
craving
to
babble
he
wants
to
chatter
but
he
has
no
listener
what
is
alphonse
ludovikovitch
doing
he
asks
the
footman
he
is
packing
his
trunk
sir
what
a
noodle
lord
forgive
us
says
kamyshev
and
goes
in
to
the
frenchman
champoun
is
sitting
on
the
floor
in
his
room
and
with
trembling
hands
is
packing
in
his
trunk
his
linen
scent
bottles
prayer
books
braces
ties
all
his
correct
figure
his
trunk
his
bedstead
and
the
table
all
have
an
air
of
elegance
and
effeminacy
great
tears
are
dropping
from
his
big
blue
eyes
into
the
trunk
where
are
you
off
to
asks
kamyshev
after
standing
still
for
a
little
the
frenchman
says
nothing
do
you
want
to
go
away
kamyshev
goes
on
well
you
know
but
i
won
t
venture
to
detain
you
but
what
is
queer
is
how
are
you
going
to
travel
without
a
passport
i
wonder
you
know
i
have
lost
your
passport
i
thrust
it
in
somewhere
between
some
papers
and
it
is
lost
and
they
are
strict
about
passports
among
us
before
you
have
gone
three
or
four
miles
they
pounce
upon
you
champoun
raises
his
head
and
looks
mistrustfully
at
kamyshev
yes
you
will
see
they
will
see
from
your
face
you
haven
t
a
passport
and
ask
at
once
who
is
that
alphonse
champoun
we
know
that
alphonse
champoun
wouldn
t
you
like
to
go
under
police
escort
somewhere
nearer
home
are
you
joking
what
motive
have
i
for
joking
why
should
i
only
mind
now
it
s
a
compact
don
t
you
begin
whining
then
and
writing
letters
i
won
t
stir
a
finger
when
they
lead
you
by
in
fetters
champoun
jumps
up
and
pale
and
wide
eyed
begins
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
what
are
you
doing
to
me
he
says
in
despair
clutching
at
his
head
my
god
accursed
be
that
hour
when
the
fatal
thought
of
leaving
my
country
entered
my
head
come
come
come
i
was
joking
says
kamyshev
in
a
lower
tone
queer
fish
he
is
he
doesn
t
understand
a
joke
one
can
t
say
a
word
my
dear
friend
shrieks
champoun
reassured
by
kamyshev
s
tone
i
swear
i
am
devoted
to
russia
to
you
and
your
children
to
leave
you
is
as
bitter
to
me
as
death
itself
but
every
word
you
utter
stabs
me
to
the
heart
ah
you
queer
fish
if
i
do
abuse
the
french
what
reason
have
you
to
take
offence
you
are
a
queer
fish
really
you
should
follow
the
example
of
lazar
isaakitch
my
tenant
i
call
him
one
thing
and
another
a
jew
and
a
scurvy
rascal
and
i
make
a
pig
s
ear
out
of
my
coat
tail
and
catch
him
by
his
jewish
curls
he
doesn
t
take
offence
but
he
is
a
slave
for
